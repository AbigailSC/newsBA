        "article": [
          "Before <strong><em>Genshin Impact</em></strong>'s Version 3.8 update has officially launched, leaks are already hinting at the lineup of four-star characters set to feature on the new patch's second half banners. Since the launch of <a href='https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-hoyoverse-revenue-2022/'>the massively successful HoYoverse RPG</a> in late 2020, the game's roster has more than tripled in size with nearly 70 playable characters available as of Version 3.7's launch. With new characters added almost every patch, the roster has continued to grow with more members adding unique playstyles. Version 3.8, however, is set to buck a longstanding trend for the RPG.",
          "With the Version 3.8 Special Program for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/genshin-impact/'><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> airing late last week, HoYoverse would confirm a major break from the norm for the final Sumeru update. Version 3.8 was confirmed to only feature re-runs of past characters with no new members added for the first time in the game's history. While the roster will not welcome any new additions, several popular characters including Klee, Sangonomiya Kokomi, and Wanderer were confirmed for re-runs during the update. Now, new leaks have hinted at the four-star banner characters for Version 3.8's second half.",
          "An update shared by <em>Genshin Impact</em> leaker Genshin Universe revealed the four-star characters set to join Wanderer and Kokomi during the second banners of Version 3.8. Version 3.8's second half is set to feature four-stars from three different nations with Sumeru four-star Faruzan, Liyue four-star Yanfei, and Mondstadt four-star Rosaria. The featured four-star character lineup is nearly identical to Wanderer's initial release in Version 3.3, only swapping Gorou out for Rosaria. Wanderer and Kokomi's banners are expected to debut in late July, three weeks after Version 3.8's launch.",
          "<h2>Genshin Impact Version 3.8 Second Half Banner Characters</h2><ul> <li> Wanderer: five-star Anemo Catalyst character </li> <li> Kokomi: five-star Hydro Catalyst character </li> <li> Faruzan: four-star Anemo Catalyst character </li> <li> Yanfei: four-star Pyro Catalyst character </li> <li> Rosaria: four-star Cryo Polearm character </li> </ul>",
          "The featured characters, as is typical for <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s banners, boast exceptional synergy with the limited five-star characters available. Faruzan has often been a staple of team compositions built around Wanderer, providing powerful Anemo Res shredding effects and boosting allies' Anemo damage. When fully built, Rosaria can also provide powerful buffs for Physical damage-focused characters like Eula, with her 4th Ascension Passive buffing allies' Crit Rate and her C6 passive adding Physical Res shred to her Elemental Burst.",
          "While Version 3.8 is not set to feature any new playable characters, the update will bring plenty of new content to close out <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s Sumeru cycle. The new version will see players whisked away to a new limited-time region with several new mini-games and sub-events. Two of Genshin Impact's oldest characters will also be receiving skins as part of the new update with both Klee and Kaeya sporting new looks for the event. HoYoverse is set to finish the Sumeru region's patch cycle with a bang as the developer prepares for the upcoming addition of Fontaine."

          "A new video for <strong><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></strong> shows Jingliu's gameplay, giving players an idea of what the upcoming character will look like on the battlefield. <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/'><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> is still new compared to its <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em> and <em>Genshin Impact</em>, but HoYoverse's title has followed the same successful path as its 'big brothers,' mainly thanks to its cast of characters.",
          "Honkai: Star Rail currently has 22 playable characters, or 24 if one counts the Trailblazer versions. This list keeps expanding. Since it's a gacha RPG, HoYoverse regularly brings new characters to <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. One example is the trio Kafka, Blade, and Luka, who have already been officially announced and should appear in version 1.2 of the game. Meanwhile, <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s leaks bring new information about potential characters almost every day.",
          "Reddit user Administrative_Ad432 shared a video revealing the gameplay for Jingliu, one of the most anticipated characters for <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> players. Although not officially announced, Jingliu is coming to Honkai: Star Rail, with several leaks bringing information about the 5-star character. The <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail_leaks/comments/14jcgth/jingliu_gameplay_ult_unfinished/'>nearly three-minute video shared by Administrative_Ad432</a> shows Jingliu in her two versions, the first where the character wears a blindfold and uses her basic attack and skill version along with her standby stance. Jingliu's face becomes fully visible when she enters the Transcendence state and removes the blindfold.",
          "In addition to assuming a new standby stance, Jingliu in the Transcendence state has a skill that consumes two stacks instead of one, gaining a flashier animation than before. The video also shows Jingliu's ultimate, and while players cannot see a complete animation, it is possible to get a general sense of what it will look like. While battling alongside the new <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> character Luocha, the video emphasizes that Jingliu is still heavily under development, so most of her animations and abilities are broken or unfinished.",
          "The Jingliu gameplay leak has made <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> players even more eager for the character. Jingliu is a powerful character with an important history in the game's universe, having been Jing Yuan's mentor when he first started joining the ranks of the Cloud Knights. Jingliu will be voiced by actress AmaLee, known for her work in anime such as <em>My Dress-Up Darling</em> and <em>Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card</em>."

        "article": [
          "During the recent <strong><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></strong> stress test, players were able to put the game through its paces and discover some previously unannounced features like the Quitality. After months of speculation with many fans assuming the next game from NetherRealm Studio would be <em>Mortal Kombat 12</em>, Ed Boon and the development team surprised just about everyone by introducing a rebooted franchise with Mortal Kombat 1.",
          "In this new timeline, Fire God Liu Kang has reshaped the world and everyone in it, sometimes for the more surprising as classic rivals Sub-Zero and Scorpion are now brothers. Alongside a brand-new story, <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> features plenty of new mechanics such as Kameo fighters that can be called upon during a match to assist the player with throws, counters, combo extenders, and even Fatalities. However, players have also begun discovering previously unannounced features that are making a comeback as well.",
          "The first stress test for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/mortal-kombat-1/'>Mortal Kombat 1</a> gave many players their first opportunity to go hands on with the game, exploring the limited roster of characters and Kameo fighters. It also gave players the chance to mess around with the various '-ality' systems in the game such as the iconic fatality moves to put a fluorish on a match victory. However, players also began to discover that the Quitality mechanic has also returned for this latest iteration.",
          "Originally introduced in 2015's <em>Mortal Kombat X</em>, Quitalities result during online Mortal Kombat matches when one player decides to leave mid-match. Not only does the other player get the victory, but their opponent's character explodes to some degree suddenly to cap of the match. Players, like FGC community member Ketchup, have been discovering all of the new gory animations added to <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> as players exit matches before the end of the round.",
          "Even as the first <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> comes to a close, it appears to have been a big success for NetherRealm Studios with a high demand from fans. In fact, it was in such high demand, that it even caught the attention of scalpers who posted <em>MK1</em> stress test access keys online for ridiculous prices. On sites like eBay, codes were being sold for a variety of prices ranging from $180 to over $800."

        "subTitle": "A newly emerged Resident Evil 4 update hints at an imminent release of DLC for Capcom's hit survival horror remake.",
        "article": [
          "A new piece of DLC for <strong><em>Resident Evil 4</em></strong> could be releasing in the immediate future, as suggested by a newly emerged update to the Steam version of the game. While Capcom has yet to confirm it intends to put out more post-launch content for the hit remake, some recently datamined Resident Evil 4 files have already pointed to the return of Separate Ways, a fan-favorite story mode.",
          "Two weeks into its release, the Resident Evil 4 remake received its first free DLC in the form of the Mercenaries mode. The move left Separate Ways as the only major piece of content from the 2005 original that's still missing from the 2023 remake.",
          "And while the Japanese developer hasn't yet confirmed that Separate Ways is actually on its way to the game, the Steam version of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> has just been updated with seven new achievements, indicating that a major content drop is on the horizon. Five of the newly added trophies are hidden, while the remaining two have placeholder names that don't reveal anything about their prerequisites or the game itself. Seeing how Separate Ways added an extensive campaign starring Ada Wong to the original game, a new version of this lengthy mode could easily account for such a significant increase in the total number of the <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake's achievements, which now stands at 46.",
          "This development dovetails with a recent Resident Evil 4 leak narrowing down the release date of the Separate Ways DLC, which suggested that the much-rumored addition will at the very least be revealed—if not released—in the second half of 2023. And while that's looking extremely plausible following this update to the game's list of achievements, what's still unclear is whether Capcom intends to charge fans for the privilege of experiencing the story of <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>from Ada Wong's perspective.",
          "Although the Mercenaries mode was released for free, the scope of Separate Ways is much closer to the likes of the Winters' Expansion for <em>Resident Evil Village</em> and <em>Resident Evil 7</em>'s End of Zoe, both of which released as paid DLC. Meanwhile, Capcom's previous two <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes didn't receive extensive post-launch support that would offer direct points of comparison; they both featured paid cosmetics, but so does <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, and such content isn't comparable to an ambitious expansion that would boost its respective game's number of achievements by 20%.",
          "It's hence possible that Capcom will opt to release Separate Ways as paid DLC. And while the expansion's business model is still unclear, what's certain is that Separate Ways will offer an entirely new perspective on the events of the <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/resident-evil-4-remake/'><em>Resident Evil 4 remake</em></a>."

          "The open beta for <strong><em>MultiVersus</em></strong> has officially shut down, but this isn't the end for the platform fighter. Warner Bros. Interactive's dive into the fighting genre has experienced an extensive open beta period, but the official closing of <em>MultiVersus</em>' beta signals a new chapter for the game.",
          "Released back in 2022, <em>MultiVersus</em> followed the path of <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. by pitting iconic Warner Bros. characters against one another in fun platform-based fighting matches. Although the game launched to a positive start, the player count for Multiversus dwindled since its release. With the falling player count, it seemed that the open beta had served its initial purpose of giving players a sneak peek. This decrease in interaction from fans was eventually followed by an announcement back in March that the open beta would be closing on June 25th. Despite the beta closing its doors, there is a still a future for <em>MultiVersus</em> that fans of the brawler title can look forward to.",
          "<em>MultiVersus</em> is set to return sometime in the first half of 2024, leaving some players eagerly waiting its eventual return. The game featured Warner Bros. characters ranging from Batman to Jake and Finn from <em>Adventure Time</em>, and the game's downtime will likely see developers fine-tuning both characters and combat in order to give players a great brawling experience when < href='https://gamerant.com/tag/multiversus/'><em>MultiVersus</em></> returns. Although it may frustrate some players that there isn't an official date for the game's 2024 launch, there are still ways fans will be able to enjoy the game.",
          "Those who have installed the game can still fight in local matches and use the training room, but all the online content will no longer be available. There are some who fear that this beta closure could be a bad move for <em>MultiVersus</em>, but all hope is not lost for the game. This beta closure could actually rile up excitement again. Absence sometimes makes the heart grow fonder, so it could possibly help the game's 2024 relaunch.",
          "Whether this beta closure helps the game's future or not, only time will tell. The positive response from many who played the beta during its initial release proves that the game has something to offer a specific audience. Until the game relaunches, there are alternatives to <em>MultiVersus</em> while it's on hiatus, and those titles could help inspire gamers to have a renewed sense of excitement for the game's relaunch. The future of <em>MultiVersus</em> is filled with unknowns, but a potential strong comeback in 2024 could give gamers a new favorite brawler to play."

        "article": [
          "A resourceful <strong><em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></strong> gamer has managed to create a working scale to measure Link’s weight. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> players are constantly inventing gadgets using the game’s extensive building systems, and this scale is definitely among the most creative ones so far.",
          "Ever since its release back in May, <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> has been a huge hit. The game was able to sell over 10 million units in the first three days, and it continued to maintain its popularity as weeks passed. Part of why gamers love the new <em>Zelda</em> so much is due to how big and packed with interesting content the open world is. Often, this can lead to some pretty interesting interactions, especially when using the new Fuse and Ultrahand abilities, which are at the heart of the game’s building system.",
          "Now, a <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/tears-of-the-kingdom/'><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> gamer was able to invent a working scale. RecommendationOk6842 recently shared a video showing their latest creation: a scale that could be used to weigh several objects in the game or even the protagonist Link himself. The device was quite simple, using real-life principles that would apply to a scale, such as having two platforms that would be weighed against each other and using gravity to do the rest of the work. Hilariously, when the gamer weighed Link, they discovered that Hyrule’s hero was just as heavy as five apples. So, either Link is very light, or the apples in the game are incredibly heavy.",
          "People in the comments of the Reddit post were already finding some cool ways to employ this scale. For instance, Doubting_Gamer had the idea of using the object to measure the lightest items which could be used to build flying devices in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. However, the game is still lacking an official measurement unit, so players were already discussing whether the official unit should be measured in apples or bananas, for instance.",
          "<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> gamers continue to express their creativity and resourcefulness in many ways with Nintendo’s latest hit, and there are many other interesting examples of that. For instance, one <em>Zelda</em> player created a working lawnmower recently, completely automating the task of cutting grass. While the invention still needed a few tweaks to be perfect, it was a fine example of how creative players can be in Nintendo’s latest title."

Besides naming their characters and outfitting them with various gear and cosmetics, players can also select from a variety of titles to give their <em>Diablo 4</em> character extra flair.",

Some <em>Diablo 4</em> titles are sought out by the community, with many fans wanting to add 'The' to their list of available titles. Since titles are made up of a Prefix and Suffix, it makes sense that many <em>Diablo 4</em> players want 'The' as part of their title roster.",
          "Blizzard's Rod Fergusson acknowledged that many <em>Diablo 4</em> players are looking to add 'The' to their title choices, and so he revealed that it's unlocked by completing all the Bear Tribe side quests in Fractured Peaks. These side quests are found in Bear Tribe Refuge, which is an area players will likely visit fairly early in their <em>Diablo 4</em> adventures. Upon completing all the side quests, players will unlock two titles: 'The' and 'Bear.'",
          "The last side quest <em>Diablo 4</em> players will have to complete at Bear Tribe Refuge is called 'Call of the Ancients', and there is a glitch associated with it that fans should be aware of if they're hoping to unlock the 'The' title. If one's co-op partner is dead when they down the boss at the end of the Call of the Ancients quest, the objective will get stuck and players will have to redo the quest from the start. This bug is avoided by making sure everyone is up and revived before killing the boss.",
          "It's possible Blizzard will fix this bug in a future update, but plans to that effect have not actually been announced at the time of this writing. <em>Diablo</em> fans do know that a sizable update is coming to the game between now and when Season 1 launches in mid-July that will make various adjustments and add quality of life improvements. Blizzard is planning to support <em>Diablo 4</em> for quite some time to come, so fans can look forward to many more updates in the months ahead."

        "article": [
          "A <strong><em>Diablo 4</em></strong> Player has used the game’s transmog system to create <em>Elden Ring</em>’s Starscourage Radahn in the game. <em>Diablo 4</em> was eagerly anticipated and did not disappoint after its recent release. The open-world RPG allows players to customize their characters to their liking. One of the ways <em>Diablo 4</em> gives players ultimate control over the style of their characters is with a transmog system.",
          "<em>Diablo 4</em>'s transmog system allows players to retain the stats of a particular piece of armor without having to wear that specific piece. It’s an option included in many RPGs that allows fashion-conscious players to customize their character’s looks as they see fit without sacrificing function. In essence, if a particular piece of armor looks good on the player’s character, but a different set has better stats, the player can use the stats of the better set while wearing the better-looking one.",
          "A <em>Diablo 4</em> fan named Broken_Mau23 in the game’s subreddit used the transmog system to deck out their character in an armor set that closely resembles the set worn by Starscourge Radahn from <em>Elden Ring</em>. Radahn’s armor set is comprised of ornate yet tarnished silver and gold plates trimmed with fur. The color of the metals is offset by the blood-red mane of hair streaming off the top of his helmet. Broken_Mau23 found a suitable stand-in for the iconic helmet with <em>Diablo 4</em>’s Zischagge helm. While Radanh’s chest piece is perhaps a bit too ornate for what <em>Diablo 4</em> has to offer, Broken_Mau23 used the Warlord Plate, which comes with bulky decorative shoulder pads that come close to mimicking Radahn’s more extravagant armor.",
          "For the legs, the crafty <em>Diablo 4</em> player used Strider’s Handwraps. While not quite like Radahn’s silver and gold gauntlets, the handwraps are of a similar enough color and tone. For the legs, they used the Sand-Worn Breeches, which are perhaps the piece of armor in <em>Diablo 4</em> that most closely resembles Radahn’s armor.",
          "Radahn was one of the most fearsome and difficult bosses in <em>Elden Ring</em> before he was nerfed in an early patch to make him less difficult. Still, his visual style is an aspect that fans latched onto. One piece of Radahn iconography that is missing, however, is the same piece that made a lot of fans fall in love with him: his horse, Leonard. Radahn’s uses his powers of levitation to stay atop his beloved yet undersized horse without crushing it. While <em>Diablo 4</em> does have horses and even horse armor, it is unlikely that Blizzard will include a tiny, scrawny horse like Leonard anytime soon."

          "In addition to the controversies surrounding the game’s setting and some of its content, the single-player first-person shooter also shipped with a lot of bugs that hampered gameplay. Mundfish has since released regular updates to iron out many of the issues, while also teasing the upcoming <em>Atomic Heart</em> DLC, which up till now only had a release window.",
          "“Annihilation Instinct,” the long-awaited DLC for <em>Atomic Heart</em> will be launching on August 2, 2023, for all platforms. The story picks up where the events of <em>Atomic Heart</em> left off, and a new trailer and its description have revealed that there will be new shape-shifting enemies in the <em>Atomic Heart</em> DLC for protagonist P-3 to take on. Players will also venture into the swamps surrounding a new location, the Mendeleev Complex, which is apparently still part of Facility 3826, where the main game takes place.",
          "Additionally, Annihilation Instinct will introduce two new weapons to <em>Atomic Heart</em>: the Secateur, which looks like a kind of energy rifle of a size similar to the Dominator, and the Klusha, which resembles a two-handed polearm-type melee weapon. P-3 also still has his glove and will gain a new Techno-Stasis ability that allows him to manipulate time.",
          "This new glove power complements the theme of the Annihilation Instinct DLC, which seems to center around uncovering the truth about NORA, the talkative vending machine that’s used to upgrade weapons and unlock new skills in <em>Atomic Heart</em>. The DLC will also bring back NPCs from the main game and introduce a new “enigmatic” character.",
          "For those who enjoy the game and don’t think a DLC will be enough, Mundfish recently released a New Game+ mode with Update 1.8.0.0, which gives enemies new abilities to watch out for. For example, the VOV-A6 Lab Tech, the mustachioed robot, will be immune to glove abilities and cartridge weapons while also enjoying increased attack and movement speeds. The developer has revealed that an <em>Atomic Heart</em> sequel is already in the works as well, though further details about that project may be a long time coming."

        "article": [
          "<strong>Bungie</strong> is already hard at work with the ongoing support of <em>Destiny 2</em> and upcoming reboot of <em>Marathon</em>, but it appears the studio's third new IP may not be as far as some players may be thinking if a new report is correct. News on the third IP, known only as Matter following a 2018 trademark filing, has been fairly light in 2023 as the studio focuses on its two known titles. However, this new information does not come directly from <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/bungie/'>Bungie</a>, but instead from the current legal litigation embroiling Microsoft's proposal to acquire Activision Blizzard.",
          "Destiny 2's current season, Season of the Deep, sees the return of Titan to the Sol System after its disappearance at the launch of 2020's <em>Beyond Light</em> expansion. Guardians have been summoned to the moon at the request of Deputy Commander Sloane, who is requesting aid to protect a creature living beneath the methane waves which may have valuable information about The Witness. However, the Hive god Xivu Arath is also making her presence in the system known more directly as her forces work to stop Sloane's plans for the creature.",
          "Despite the near constant support required for <em>Destiny 2</em> and development of the new <em>Marathon</em>, new documents from Microsoft's FTC hearings suggest <em>Matter</em> could be releasing sometime in 2025. The hearing documents specifically contain an evaluation of Bungie done by Microsoft in 2021, outlining some of the studio's plans at the time for expansion and game support. It points out how the studio 'has more than doubled its headquarter space' and was set to open its first international office in Amsterdam in 2022, the latter of which would focus on <em>Destiny 2</em> support and development of <em>Matter</em>.",
          "The internal evaluation by Microsoft lines up with additional reports suggesting the tech giant was interested in acquiring Bungie, along with Sega, in 2020. By that time, the studio was known to be working on a new IP, <em>Matter</em>, and had received a $100 million investment Chinese tech company NetEase to go toward the new project. Updates became few and far between following this news, though it has been confirmed the <em>Marathon</em> reboot is an entirely different project from the third IP.",
          "Since the time of the evaluation, Bungie has seen quite a few changes occur on the business side as the studio is no longer independent. Sony completed its acquisition of the studio for roughly $3.6 billion in July 2022, joining a roster of first-party studios which include Sucker Punch and Insomniac. It also remains to be seen if the 2025 release window in the 2021 evaluation remains accurate, or if the new IP may be further off than players think."

        "subTitle": "A member of the Alan Wake 2 development team has spoken out in defense of the game's fast approaching digital-only release later this year.",
        "article": [
          "Some fans are disappointed that there will not be a physical release for <strong><em>Alan Wake 2</em></strong>, and the developer has now revealed the logic behind the decision. There has been some discourse around digital-only releases for AAA games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, with many fans being concerned by what appears to be a growing trend with big-league developers.",
          "Some of the main concerns around digital-only releases are well-established. Somewhat ironically, the original <em>Alan Wake</em> was pulled from digital storefronts for over a year due to music licensing issues. While it was eventually made available once everything was ironed out, the fact remains that nobody could buy <em>Alan Wake</em> for 17 months. Game collectors and preservationists are generally outspoken about the importance of physical releases; there is always a possibility that a digital storefront will be closed at some point, and physical releases are a way of ensuring that a game is available to play if this ever happens.",
          "Kyle Rowley, the game director for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/alan-wake-2/'><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, has defended the digital-only release of the game. In an interview with Eurogamer, Rowley explains that taking the digital-only release route allows the team 'more time to polish the game' and explains that the game that goes on a physical release would need to be playable without a patch several weeks ahead of launch. This is termed 'going gold', which refers to a version of a game (the 'gold master' version) that the publisher deems complete and ready to ship. By skipping out on this step and going with a digital-only release, Remedy can essentially keep working on <em>Alan Wake 2</em> until the day it launches.",
          "There are a few ways fans of <em>Alan Wake</em> can look at this news. The first one is in the light of optimism; it certainly would be remiss if <em>Alan Wake 2</em> was immortalized on a physical medium in an unplayable state, and it would also be in poor taste to ship a physical copy of the game that is little more than a DRM key on a disc. Remedy has done well to temper fans' expectations, but Rowley's words might exacerbate some concerns about <em>Alan Wake 2</em> after its Summer Game Fest trailer was a little light on gameplay.",
          "It could be that digital-only releases are becoming a third option for developers who are deciding between releasing a game that they don't feel is ready or delaying it. That said, the developers of <em>Alan Wake 2</em> have spoken confidently about their work in the context of its October release, with the month typically being saturated with exciting horror releases in the build-up to Halloween."

        "article": [
          "<strong><em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></strong> just released its biggest Unearthed Arcana playtest packet in its long history. This massive document includes revisions for multiple classes, subclasses, spells, feats, and other <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/dungeons-and-dragons/'><em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a> rules.",
          "Wizards of the Coast is in the process of revising <em>5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons</em> to become an evergreen system. This initiative, called <em>One D&D</em>, has involved rigorous playtesting via Unearthed Arcana documents full of revised rules and new content.",
          "Its most recent Unearthed Arcana packet is its biggest one yet. This 77-page document includes tons of revisions, many of which build upon previous playtests and surveys. Several spell lists, spells, and feats have received continued tweaks in an effort to improve the game, and Weapon Mastery from the last <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> playtest has been refined and expanded to other classes. Additionally, seven full classes appear in the document, including Monk–the only one not published in an Unearthed Arcana yet.",
          "Here are some of the biggest changes each <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> class received:",
          "<ul> <li> Bards can now use spell slots when they run out of Bardic Inspiration, have more freedom in what spells they learn, and have a powerful capstone ability called Words of Creation. </li> <li> Clerics now always have the Commune spell prepared, can deal damage with Turn Undead, and can cast the Wish spell using Greater Divine Intervention. </li> <li> Druid Wildshapes changes have been partially reverted, but all Druids can transform as a bonus action and can improve their Wildshape attacks or cantrips with Elemental Fury. </li> <li> Monk Martial Arts dice scale from a d6 to a d12, but only affect unarmed strikes. Additionally, several Monk abilities are renamed and reworked, and they have a new capstone called Defy Death. </li> <li> Paladins can now use Lay on Hands as a bonus action, and Divine Smite has been reworked into a series of Paladin-only spells. </li> <li> <a href='https://gamerant.com/dungeons-dragons-5e-best-ranger-builds/'>Rangers gain iconic <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a> spells like Hunter’s Mark and Conjure Barrage for free, and have an improved version of Foe Slayer as a final ability. </li> <li> Rogues can reduce their sneak attack damage to inflict conditions and maneuver around the battlefield with Cunning Strike and Devious Strikes. </li> </ul>",
          "Additionally, the two classes received two never-before-seen subclasses: the College of Dance Bard and the Circle of the Sea Druid. The College of Dance gives the Bard powerful support abilities reminiscent of a Monk, and the Circle of the Sea grants Druids abilities to navigate the skies and the oceans and to control the battlefield cold, lightning, and thunder damage. If these subclasses are printed, players can expect them in the revised <em>5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook</em> planned for 2024."

        "subTitle": "As part of its latest Steam Summer Sale, Valve is offering its popular handheld Steam Deck at discounted rates for the second time this year.",
        "article": [
          "Valve's <strong>Steam Deck</strong> is now on sale at a discounted rate as part of this year's Steam Summer Sale. The company's gaming hardware has been a hit among gamers since its debut last year, with many titles ranging from <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to Hi-Fi Rush supporting the Steam Deck. As its latest Steam sale kicks off, Valve is seemingly looking to capitalize on the Steam Deck's appeal.",
          "Of course, it's no surprise that the Steam Deck continues to be a popular choice among many gamers. Customers had to wait eight months to order the device without reservations thanks to challenges in meeting demands with sufficient supply. The Steam Deck reportedly crossed a million units around October 2022. By early March, Valve's internal research indicated that about 42% of Steam Deck owners prefer gaming on the device as compared to other platforms.",
          "Following this growing appeal, Valve has put up the <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/steam-deck/'>Steam Deck</a> for sale alongside the slew of discounted games at the latest Steam Summer Sale. While Valve previously offered the Steam Deck on sale back in March, gamers rarely get the opportunity to get a hold of the handheld device at a discounted rate. This means interested buyers can now grab the 64GB base model at a 10% discount for $359.10 whereas the 256GB model ships 15% off at $449.65. Additionally, gamers can buy the 512GB Steam Deck for $519.20, which is $129.80 off its usual pricing. The cheaper offering will be available for purchase on the Steam Store from 29 June to 13 July.",
          "While the hardware's popularity continues, Valve is also actively investing in its software improvements. Recently, the company unveiled a notable visual overhaul to the Steam desktop client that affected its font, notifications, and download tab among other areas. Of course, the updated UI made its way to mobile and Steam Deck as well. Additionally, the changes included a refreshed in-game overlay for desktop users along with a new Notes feature that was previously available in a Steam beta client version.",
          "As of now, it remains to be seen if Valve will choose to offer the Steam Deck at discounted rates anytime soon following the Steam Summer Sale. Although, it's safe to assume the company may have plans for another Steam Deck sale during the year, particularly considering the slew of Steam sale events in 2023. Regardless, this would come as welcome news to PC gamers who have been considering a viable handheld option like the <strong>Steam Deck</strong>. As to how far its appeal carries through for Valve in the months, if not years to come, only time will tell."

        "article": [
          "Voice actor Luke Roberts, who will play James Sunderland in the <strong><em>Silent Hill 2</em></strong> remake, has seemingly hinted at the long-awaited title's release date. Rumors indicate that the <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake is close to completion, but this hint indicates players have a small wait on their hands yet.",
          "It's been an incredible few years for fans of horror remakes. Capcom has had an enormous amount of success remaking its iconic <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, with each title received brilliantly. The hope is that Konami and Bloober Team can recreate that same success with <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/silent-hill/'>Silent Hill 2</a>. While the franchises are certainly different in many ways, there's no denying that there's a significant overlap in player base there. In many ways, Capcom has done the leg work by getting gamers excited about horror again, and teed up the ball for Bloober Team perfectly. Now all the studio has to do is hit <em>Silent Hill 2</em> out of the park.",
          "The news comes from the video game forum ResetEra, where a user allegedly direct messaged Roberts on Instagram asking when <em>Silent Hill 2</em> was set to be released. His response was a short but sweet 'Early next year I believe...' Just a few weeks ago, a release date of September 29 leaked for the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, contradicting Roberts' message here. It should be said that this date came from an online website, where placeholder dates are often used in lieu of actual release dates. If the message from Luke Roberts is real, players should be inclined to believe him, as the actor for the game's protagonist should probably have some inkling of when it will release.",
          "Despite the date being later than many might have expected, it does make sense. Since the Silent Hill 2 remake was first announced with a trailer in October 2022, there has yet to be any official marketing for the game from Bloober Team. If it was to be released this year as many fans had speculated, a greater marketing push would probably have been expected by now. Of course, no two games are the same, and the developer could simply be taking a different approach, but a release this year is becoming increasingly unlikely.",
          "No matter when the game releases, it's just good to see <em>Silent Hill</em> rise from the dead. The last release in the series was <em>Silent Hill: Downpour</em>, which came all the way back in 2012. After nothing came of <em>P.T.</em> back in 2014, gamers could be forgiven for thinking <em>Silent Hill</em>'s hiatus was a permanent one. But with <em>Silent Hill F</em> on the way in the future too, it seems as though Konami is all in on <em>Silent Hill</em> once more."

A year later, Crash returned in <em>Crash Bandicoot: On the Run</em>, an endless runner mobile game published and developed by <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> studio King.",
          "A third <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> game was announced after months of speculation during The Game Awards 2022 last December. <em>Titled Crash Team Rumble</em>, this online multiplayer game features Crash and his colorful cast of supporting characters battling it out across various tropical landscapes to see who can collect the most Wumpa Fruit in frantic 4v4 skirmishes. Reviews for <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> have been generally mixed so far, with some criticizing the game’s monetization and others praising its smooth controls.",
          "Twitch users might have a more resoundingly negative opinion though, as <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/crash-team-rumble/'><em>Crash Team Rumble</em></a> is currently underperforming in terms of livestream views. As reported by VideoGamer, <em>Crash Team Rumble</em>’s Twitch numbers have dropped to less than 30 viewers. In comparison, other recently released multiplayer titles include <em>Street Fighter 6</em> at 19k viewers, <em>BattleBit Remastered</em> at 14k spectators, and F1 23 at 3.5k viewers.",
          "Releasing <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> around the same time as these other blockbuster multiplayer games might have contributed to its lackluster Twitch performance, and the rest of 2023 is filled with even more notable games. Activision’s minimal promotion for <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> may have also hurt it, as many fans on social media have expressed surprise that a new <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> game was released last week.",
          "There is still plenty of time for <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> to gain traction on Twitch, especially since developer Toys for Bob is already hinting at additional playable characters being introduced in the near future alongside the expected quality-of-life refinements. However, the rest of 2023 is looking pretty stacked, and <em>Crash Team Rumble</em>’s lower-than-average Twitch numbers are not a promising sign of success for the colorful yet divisive online multiplayer battle royale."

        "article": [
          "The PC release of the highly anticipated <strong><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></strong> is being moved forward, while the PS5 version is getting pushed back just a few days. It's been over 20 years since the last mainline installment in the beloved RPG franchise, and <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3/'><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a> will be looking to capture a new generation of RPG fans.",
          "<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, officially announced in 2019, had previously stamped a release date for August 31 of this year. As it's been such a long wait for <em>Baldur's Gate</em> fans since the first two BioWare-developed titles, the excitement surrounding this massive third installment has been palpable. 2023 has been a behemoth year for video game releases with legendary, long-established franchises dropping massive mainline installments like <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>. As the upcoming Fall season of games isn't intent on slowing down, Larian Studios has had to adjust its landing for <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.",
          "In a community update on Steam, <em>Baldur's Gate</em> announced it's moving its PC release date forward almost a whole month to August 3, and that the PS5 version will see a slight delay to September 6. In speaking with IGN, <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> director and studio founder Swen Vincke cites the business of 2023's competitive release calendar, pointing to massive titles that have recently been released like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, as well as the imminent <em>Starfield</em>, which serves as direct competition to <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> as a western RPG, even more so now with <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s PS5 version landing on <em>Starfield</em>'s release day.",
          "According to Larian, the purpose of shifting the PC version of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> forward to August 3 was to give gamers a better opportunity to spend time with the game before other big RPG competitors like <em>Starfield</em> launch in the Fall. Holding firm on that August 31 release date would mean Larian would be launching its game one day before <em>Starfield</em>'s early access period begins on September 1. This decision may seem sound in a vacuum, but seeing that Larian is simultaneously pushing the PS5 version of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> onto <em>Starfield</em>'s exact release day seems questionable. However, Vincke clarified that this daring move was made for the purpose of the team having extra time to make sure it hits its 60 FPS performance target on PS5.",
          "While it's true that <em>Baldur's Gate 3 </em>and <em>Starfield</em> are two RPGs of different settings, one fantasy and one sci-fi, Larian knows that there are still many gamers wanting to dive into both of them. It's incredibly rare to see a studio thinking about its playerbase's time like this and making schedule changes to ensure its fans have the time to play what they want. While PC and PS5 gamers get to delve into the world of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> this year, the jury's still out on when Xbox's version of the massive fantasy RPG will arrive."

        "article": [
          "<strong>Bloober Team</strong>, the game developer behind the upcoming <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and <em>Layers of Fear</em>, has recently confirmed that the studio is now done with psychological horror games, and will focus on mass-market horror in the future. Bloober Team is known for making some of the best psychological horror games out there, so it’s a controversial decision, to say the least.",
          "Last year, it was announced that Bloober Team would remake <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, perhaps the most beloved entry in Konami’s horror franchise. <em>Silent Hill 2</em> was known for its unique take on psychological horror before it was something common, and the game stood out among similar survival horror games of its time due to its unnerving atmosphere and a focus on the protagonist’s mental state. Bloober Team seems like a great fit for the remake exactly because of the studio’s experience with creating similar horror experiences.",
          "Now, Piotr Babieno, the CEO of the studio, revealed in an interview with Engadget that the recent release of the Layers of Fear remake was the swan song of the company’s classic style of making games. Babieno described the old style of the game as focusing on story, mood, and vibes, but not giving a lot of attention to the mechanics of the game. Now, the studio will transform into what is known as “Bloober Team 3.0” internally, and move towards a more mass-market-oriented horror design, making bigger titles that will have a lot of gameplay mechanics.",
          "Babieno also confirmed that the upcoming remake of Konami’s horror franchise will be the first time <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/bloober-team/'>Bloober Team</a> will test out its new philosophy. This could mean that the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake will prioritize gameplay over the “vibes,” or only that the company is ready to give it more polish and make the gameplay feel better than the other titles it has put out before.",
          "While it’s impossible to say if this shift in the studio’s strategy is bad news for the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake or a good move forward, one developer believes that it’ll be hard to develop the game anyway. In a recent interview, Sam Barlow, who worked on the remake of the first title of the franchise, <em>Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</em>, said that the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is a poison chalice. After all, the job of reimagining such a classic horror game won’t be easy, and some fans will always be left unsatisfied."

        "article": [
          "Remedy Entertainment has revealed that <strong><em>Alan Wake 2</em></strong>'s combat will have a slower pace compared to the original game. According to Co-Director Sam Lake, <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/alan-wake-2/'><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a> will have a slower combat pace to be closer to survival horror.",
          "Despite its horror setting, <em>Alan Wake</em> always had a more action-like approach to combat. The game featured fast-paced shooting sections in which the protagonist had to shake off hordes of enemies using the power of a flashlight and a gun. While the original had fast-paced combat encounters, they don't fit well in the survival-horror genre.",
          "Because of this, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s pace will be 'slowed down' compared to the first game. Co-Director Sam Lake mentioned in the latest issue of PLAY Magazine that the game will feature less combat as <em>Alan Wake 2</em> shifts to survival horror genre. According to Sam Lake, the combat in <em>Alan Wake</em> was very 'samey' and shifting to survival horror was an approach that 'made a lot of sense'. The slower combat will allow players to have more meaningful encounters and make a bigger event out of every fight.",
          "This contrast in combat encounters found in <em>Alan Wake 2</em> can be felt from the very first gameplay trailer, as enemies looked to be a lot tougher compared to the previous game. With Sam Lake's comments in mind, this approach makes much more sense as the game focuses on making the enemy density lower compared to the original game. 'The first game was an action adventure game – it had horror elements, but it was an action adventure game. And there were elements there that we wanted to fix, if you will – the fact that the combat is very samey and there is a lot of it through the whole experience. [...] Less combat, the pacing is slowed down – it allows us to be more ambitious with the story.'",
          "<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s atmosphere was the most prominent feature during the Summer Game Fest. However, the game will retain the elements that defined the first game such as having to shine enemies with the flashlight in order to purge the darkness for a short period of time and exposing them to gunfire. While Remedy Entertainment still hasn't revealed too much regarding the combat, this new comment gives fans a lot of perspective about where the game will go from here."

This absolutely massive discount is thanks to the ongoing Steam Summer Sale, an annual tradition that seems Valve's digital distribution platform offer some jaw-dropping discounts on big games.",
          "This year's Steam Summer Sale is running from June 29 to July 13, so <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/steam/'><em>Steam</em></a> users have a couple of weeks to take advantage of the savings. Big games like the <em>Dead Space</em> remake, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> are all enjoying healthy discounts, while users can also get the Steam Deck at a lower price as well. However, arguably the best deal out of the bunch is the Valve Complete Pack, which has had its price knocked down by 96% while the Steam Summer Sale is live.",
          "The Valve Complete Pack, available for just $6.54 for a limited time, comes with 22 games, some of which are considered to be some of the best video games of all time. This includes both <em>Half-Life</em> games, both <em>Left 4 Dead</em> games, and both <em>Portal</em> games. The Valve Complete Pack is genuinely one of the best deals in gaming even when it's at full price, so being able to get all these titles and more for $6.54 is an absolute steal. Again, those interested have until July 13 at 10am PT to jump on the opportunity to buy the Valve Complete Pack at a 96% discount.",
          "Those that are diligent about taking advantage of the best Steam deals very likely already have these games, and in fact, they may have acquired them through the Valve Complete Pack. As some may recall, the Valve Complete Pack enjoyed an identical discount a few months back during the Steam Spring Sale. Offering so many games at such a low price is a good way to draw in customers who may then see some of the other deals on offer and be tempted to pick up some other titles while they're grabbing the Valve Complete Pack.",
          "Of course, it's worth pointing out that the Valve Complete Pack isn't really 'complete' anymore. Valve has since released new games that are currently not part of the bundle, with the most notable being acclaimed VR game <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>. It will be interesting to see if Valve ever updates the Valve Complete Pack offerings, but even if it doesn't, it's still easily one of the best deals in all of gaming."

The open world Soulslike's popularity has persisted since then, but if its resurgence to the top of Steam's best-sellers list is any indication, it seems there are still many who have yet to give <em>Elden Ring</em> a shot.",
          "<em>Elden Ring</em> has been credited with breaking down the boundaries that have kept many gamers from enjoying FromSoftware's Soulslikes. <em>Elden Ring</em>'s open world format has lent itself well to FromSoftware's formula, giving those who would normally be turned off by the roadblocks players often bump into in those games the chance to simply explore in a different direction and keep playing in situations that would have normally seen them give up.",
          "Now <em>Elden Ring</em> has found itself back at the very top of Steam's top sellers after the Steam Summer Sale went live and gave the game a nice 30% discount, allowing newcomers to pick it up for just $41.99 instead of the usual $59.99 asking price. With <em>Elden Ring</em> winning Game of the Year at the 2022 Game Awards and standing as one of the best-selling games of all time, it's really no surprise that many Steam users are jumping at the opportunity to add it to their digital libraries. Since the Steam Summer Sale lasts until July 13, it will be interesting to see if it's able to climb back to the very top.",
          "The rest of the top 10 is quite interesting. Right now, the best-seller is the Steam Deck, Valve's handheld gaming device. The $399.00 version of the Steam Deck is currently discounted by 10% as part of the Steam Summer Sale. It's relatively rare for gaming consoles to get price discounts, so anyone that wants to get a Steam Deck at a slightly lower price than usual should take advantage of this deal while they can.",
          "Following the Steam Deck are <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> (which is a free-to-play game, so it has an unfair advantage, to say the least), <em>BattleBit Remastered</em>, <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/elden-ring/'><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, the critically-acclaimed Dave the Diver, open world <em>Harry Potter</em> action-RPG <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, early access game <em>Six Days in Fallujah</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>.

For years, players have been asking for the release of an <em>Overwatch</em> animated series, which did not chang with the release of <em>Overwatch 2</em>. <em>Overwatch 2</em> players continue to wait for a production that tells them more about fan favorite heroes like Mercy and Tracer, or reveals details about major events in <em>Overwatch</em>'s lore. Thankfully, an upcoming project seems to be a step toward that.",

In the first image, players can see the control room screen from launch, while the second shows the same screen after one of the updates <em>Overwatch 2</em> received this year. The player notices that one of the images on the 'active threats' screen got replaced, and this image is one of the scenes in the Genesis announcement trailer.",

In the announcement trailer, <em>Overwatch 2</em> players spotted some scenes from the Omnic Crisis, which would make the miniseries a prequel to the events of <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Another highlight of the trailer is the appearance of Mina Liao, one of the leading robotics experts in the <em>Overwatch</em> universe. Mina Liao is a key figure in the development of Omnics who is best known for having created Echo, the damage hero from <em>Overwatch 2</em>.",
          "While Genesis is not a large-scale project released in cinemas or by a streaming platform, the animated miniseries comes at a crucial time for <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Since its launch, <em>Overwatch 2</em> has experienced constant controversy over constant issues with bugs, balancing, and poor matchmaking. Last month, Blizzard ignited another debate by limiting access to <em>Overwatch 2</em>'s story missions and requiring players to pay for the content. With the release of Genesis, Blizzard is attempting to bring positive attention to <em>Overwatch 2</em> by exploring a still-popular facet of the franchise: the story."

        "article": [
          "A leak from the latest <strong><em>Counter-Strike 2</em></strong> update has revealed a massive rework to Inferno, one of the game's most popular maps. <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> features plenty of huge changes from <em>CS:GO</em>, but a rework of Inferno is a surprise to most.",
          "The reveal of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> earlier this year was a massive surprise. <em>CS:GO</em>'s popularity was creeping up after a few years of stagnation, and shaking the formula up in any way risked disrupting that. It did anything but. <em>CS:GO</em> broke its own Steam player record upon <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s reveal, and proceeded to repeat the feat multiple times in the months after. The <em>Counter-Strike</em> franchise has always been a staple of the FPS genre, but at the moment it seems to have entered a new stratosphere of popularity among casual and hardcore gamers. Hopefully, the release of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> doesn't disappoint, and the numbers continue to grow each day.",
          "The post in question was posted by Reddit iMarbot and can be viewed here, and it includes screenshots of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s version of Inferno. The visual style of the map has received a massive overhaul, but the biggest change comes on the A-site, which is typically seen as one of the hardest to retake in the game. Players can no longer hide behind the graveyard stairs on the A-site, giving players entering the bombsite one less place to check. It's an enormous change that will affect how the map is played, from the lowest levels all the way up to competitive play. As well as this, the area formerly known as 'construction' by players has now become 'church', with Valve using it to show off <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/counter-strike/'><em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>'s fancy new lighting engine.",
          "These screenshots appear to have been data-mined from the latest <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> update, which removed Mirage from the Closed Test map pool and instead added Nuke and Office. At the moment, Valve is slowly releasing maps to players one by one, so it can iron out any major bugs before the game releases in full later this Summer. While the gameplay changes to the map have been well-received, not everyone is a huge fan of the color. In the Reddit thread, many refer to the map's desaturation, especially given that Inferno is one of the most colorful maps in <em>CS:GO</em>. Everything is still in flux at the moment, so Valve could still make bolder color decisions in the final version of Inferno.",
          "Despite consistent updates to the Closed Test, Valve remains coy about when the full game will actually drop. It was given a tentative 'Summer 2023' date when it was first revealed, so in theory, it could drop any day now. <em>CS:GO</em> skin prices have gone wild after <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s reveal, and at this point, it's hard to imagine anything calming it down given the incredible hype for the game."

          "<em>Minecraft</em>'s success inspired a wide variety of games where players can have the same experience of surviving, building, and adventuring. Examples include <em>Stardew Valley</em>, <em>Fallout 4</em>, and even <em>Trove</em>, a charismatic sandbox RPG whose graphics will remind a lot of Mojang's game. <em>Minecraft</em> also got spin-offs like the recent <em>Minecraft Legends</em>, which offer a fun experience inspired by the original game. For <em>Minecraft</em> players, there is a world that captivates people of all ages to bring their ideas to life.",
          "Reddit user octavian_world showed other <em>Minecraft</em> players their impressive world that took nine years to complete.

Other pictures show the city at night and in the rain, which gives it a darker, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>-esque appearance. Additional images shared by the player show a large forest with tall trees, and snowy mountains reminiscent of the iconic snowy area in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. The world created by octavian_world is impressive for its detail and how long it has existed, meaning the project survived through years of <em>Minecraft</em> updates.",

In the comments, the player said the images 'showed maybe 4% of their world', making <em>Minecraft</em> players curious about the dimensions of the project. Players have asked octavian_world to put the world up for download, and the player said they are considering downloads, but it is not yet fully confirmed. In the meantime, the player will open public servers starting with a pre-event in November this year, and the launch of the full server for <em>Minecraft</em> players next year.",
          "The <em>Minecraft</em> community always gives very creative uses to the game's resources to make different kinds of projects. Many players like to recreate locations from games in <em>Minecraft</em> or places from anime and movies. The patience of <em>Minecraft</em> players is also enormous for working on original ideas, be they medieval worlds, temples, and even games within <em>Minecraft</em>. These ideas take the 'make your own adventure' philosophy of sandbox games to the next level and help <em>Minecraft</em> stand the test of time."

        "subTitle": "A well-known game studio hits back at PlayStation's claims that developers and publishers dislike Xbox Game Pass for being 'value destructive.'",
        "article": [
          "Sports Interactive Director Miles Jacobson hit back at Sony's recent criticism of <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong>. During Microsoft's federal trial with the FTC over its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, it came to light that PlayStation's Jim Ryan called Xbox Game Pass destructive, positing that 'all' major publishers 'unanimously' dislike the service.",
          "While Microsoft's attorneys questioned Ryan's suggestion that he speaks for the entire industry, the Sony Computer Interactive CEO insisted that this unfavorable perspective of Xbox Game Pass was a commonly held view across the gaming space. This wasn't the first that the executive pushed back against the $68.7 billion deal, as Ryan repeatedly met with regulators over the Activision Blizzard acquisition since Microsoft announced its blockbuster buyout attempt in early 2022.",
          "Ryan's latest criticism of Xbox Game Pass has now been directly disputed by Jacobson, with the Sports Interactive boss asserting that PlayStation doesn't speak for all third-party developers and publishers. Elaborating on that point in a recent interview with Eurogamer, Jacobson said that 'different games work well in different situations', suggesting that generalized statements like Ryan's claim that 'all' publishers dislike Xbox Game Pass have little basis in reality. From Sports Interactive's perspective, the decision to bring <em>Football Manager</em> to Xbox Game Pass yielded extremely positive results, not least because it massively expanded the reach of the studio's flagship series, Jacobson revealed.",
          "Sports Interactive's parent company appears to share that sentiment, as Sega previously went on record to praise Xbox Game Pass, citing it as a major factor driving the continued growth of its numerous franchises. Apart from <em>Football Manager</em>, the Japanese publisher has so far brought many games from the <em>Yakuza</em> and <em>Persona</em> series to Xbox Game Pass. Its partnership with Microsoft has also been deepening in recent times, as underlined by the fact that the recently announced <em>Persona 3</em> Reload and <em>Persona 5</em> Tactica will be day-one Xbox Game Pass releases, which is a first for this long-running JRPG franchise.",
          "Asked about the recent revelation that Microsoft considered buying Sega prior to proposing the Activision Blizzard acquisition, Jacobson said he had no knowledge of that possibility. The Sports Interactive chief explained that he's 'normally' informed about such high-level developments, implying Microsoft never entered any serious acquisition talks with Sega.",
          "Sports Interactive's willingness to support subscription-based game services doesn't end with <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/'><em>Xbox Game Pass</em></a>; back in late 2022, the UK studio decided to launch <em>Football Manager 2023</em> Touch as an Apple Arcade exclusive. Some half a year later, Sony added a time-limited trial of <em>Football Manager 2023</em> to the list of its PS Plus Premium perks."

          "The remaster of the hit dinosaur survival game <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>, <strong><em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em></strong>, which is being built in Unreal Engine 5, has seen a small delay from its original August release date. Originally announced earlier this year, <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/ark-survival-evolved/'><em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em></a> is aiming to bundle all the original game's DLC expansions into one cleaner-looking package ahead of its <em>Ark 2</em> sequel.",
          "Since its 2015 release, <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em> has quickly become one of the most popular titles in the world of survival games with its focus on being able to fight and tame an array of different dinosaurs. Having been first revealed at The Game Awards 2020, the sequel <em>Ark 2</em> is set to feature Hollywood actor Vin Diesel as it carries the survival franchise forward using Epic's newly developed Unreal Engine 5. With some of the very first Unreal 5 games like <em>Lords of the Fallen</em> and <em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</em> finally beginning to near release dates, <em>Ark</em> fans have been eager to learn more about <em>Ark 2</em> and <em>Survival Ascended</em>. Though, fans will now have to wait a bit longer for the latter.",
          "Developer Studio Wildcard has announced the delay of the <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em> remaster from August to October, with no specific date, as the team works through some challenges with Unreal Engine 5. The DLC expansions from the first game that are set to be included in <em>Survival Ascended</em> will be fragmented and released following the remaster's October launch. The Island DLC will be included in <em>Survival Ascended</em> day one, while Scorched Earth will be made available in December. Additionally, the Ragnarok and Aberration DLC expansions will make their way to the remaster in Q1 2024.",
          "The price of <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em> will see a change as well. Its previous $60 price tag will be lowered to $45 for early access with a $5 discount at launch. Additionally, with <em>Survival Ascended</em> essentially replacing the original <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em> game, a changing of the guard for the servers will need to take place. Now that <em>Survival Ascended</em> has been delayed to August, the <em>Survival Evolved</em> servers will see closure on September 30. The <em>Ark</em> community has been displeased with having to purchase the remaster in order to continue playing. Since this is a live service survival game, making the remaster a free update for existing players would be ideal, especially with <em>Survival Evolved</em> being taken offline permanently, but this isn't the case as of now.",
          "As the wait for <em>Ark 2</em> continues, fans of the dino survival sandbox can look forward to a potentially better looking version of the original game this Fall. As this coming October is loaded with major blockbusters like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, <em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, and more, it'll be interesting to see if <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em> will be able to cultivate and maintain a larger audience of new fans ahead of <em>Ark</em> 2."

        "article": [
          "Square Enix has canceled <strong><em>Just Cause: Mobile</em></strong> and will promptly be removing its beta version from Google Play. The ill-fated project was meant to be the first-ever <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/just-cause/'><em>Just Cause</em></a> spin-off not made by Avalanche Studios Group but one of Square Enix's internal teams. The iOS version of the game will hence never see the light of day.",
          "Square Enix originally announced <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> in late 2020 with an eye for a 2021 release. However, the game ended up suffering multiple delays with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Japanese gaming giant did end up launching an early access version of <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> for Android smartphones and tablets in November 2021, but that release was limited to Singapore. The preview eventually made its way to several more countries in Southeast Asia by mid-2022, but that's as far as it went.",
          "Following multiple <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> delays, the game has now been canceled, VGC reports, citing an official confirmation from Square Enix Global Brand Manager Anne-Lou Grosbois-Favreau. The company representative thanked the fans for their support of the project, adding that game cancellation announcements are 'never easy.' This turn of events might not come as a surprise to anyone who played the early access version of <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em>, as Square Enix already refunded all in-game purchases on February 24, Grosbois-Favreau confirmed.",
          "The version history of <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> is another piece of evidence suggesting that the project wasn't killed overnight, as its still-active Google Play page reveals that the preview version of the game was last updated in mid-December 2022. For clarity, early access titles are typically updated on a regular basis, with monthly or even weekly patches being a fairly typical occurrence for such games. So, while Square Enix had only now officially pulled the plug on this project, it would appear that <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> had been on the ropes since at least last year.",
          "The decision to cancel <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> was possibly partially motivated by its developer-publisher's recent commercial struggles. Back in February, Square Enix reported a worrying decline in sales across the board, which prompted the company to announce a number of resource consolidation efforts, including its decision to absorb Forspoken developer Luminous Productions in May.",
          "The cancellation of <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> won't necessarily have any bearing on the future of the franchise itself. Back in mid-2022, Square Enix already hinted at Just Cause 5 being in development, having assured investors that this long-running series wasn't part of its $300 million deal with Embracer Group that recently saw it sell some of its Western studios and IPs to the Swedish holding company."

        "article": [
          "It seems Ubisoft Montreal is adding a new interesting feature into <strong><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em></strong> that will give players more information about the time period and setting of the upcoming video game. With many of the <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> gameplay features mostly centering around the series' main theme of espionage, it is not surprising for the devs to bring back another one that will help educate the player base.",
          "Since the official announcement of <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> in 2022, Ubisoft has slowly been revealing more information about the upcoming game. Fans now have more details about its story, setting, and the gameplay, allowing them a sneak peek of what to expect once the title fully launches in 2023. Now that traversal and battle features have been made clear, it seems Ubisoft wants to make players more excited about all the other bells and whistles, especially the educational aspect of <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>.",
          "In a recent news post on the Ubisoft website, the team shared that a new feature called the 'History of Baghdad' will be included in <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/assassins-creed-mirage/'><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em></a>. Integrated as part of the in-game Codex and database, the feature will provide players with historical context about locations, items, and cultural events that they will encounter while they journey with the main character Basim throughout ninth century Baghdad. Players can unlock this information via their playthrough, and these articles will fall under five different topics such as Economy, Belief & Daily Life, Government, Art & Science, and Court Life.",
          "To make the History of Baghdad as historically accurate as possible, Ubisoft had employed the historian Dr. Raphaël Weyland to work specifically on the development of <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>. Weyland was given the freedom to curate most of the content that would appear in the Codex feature, specifically elements that players could discover in the game. Ubisoft also partnered with different Middle East history experts and international museums with incredible exhibits of Islamic art in order to bring Baghdad to life in the video game.",
          "Though many in the player base are more interested in how <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> will play, there are those who will probably enjoy the game for the historical information it can provide. Given just how dedicated Ubisoft has been in making sure many of their historical settings are accurate and concise, the same can probably be expected with <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>. Until then, fans will have to wait until launch day to find out and see this for themselves."        ],

        "article": [
          "The creative director of <strong><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></strong>, Emile Morel, has passed away at the age of 40, leaving behind a legacy of beloved Ubisoft classics and more. A Ubisoft game designer with a particularly long and storied tenure, Morel worked on <em>Rayman Legends</em>, among numerous other titles, which is often considered to be one of the finest side-scrolling platforming titles of all time.",
          "<a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/beyond-good-and-evil-2/'><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> has had a long and troubled development period, with Morel only taking over the project earlier in 2023. While this meant that he didn't have the opportunity to see the project through before passing, his team members have highlighted that Morel did leave a lasting impression and appears to have been happy with the game's progress.",
          "Ubisoft reiterated earlier this year that <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> is still in development, even though there hadn't been any major news on that front for some time at that point. The unexpected passing of its creative director will surely slow things down for the rest of the dev team. Ubisoft is yet to comment on Morel's death and what it means for the game's continued production.",
          "As one of the biggest contemporary game productions seemingly stuck in development hell, the loss of <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>'s second creative director is a huge deal. It's worth remembering that Morel took over from the game's previous creative director, Jean-Marc Geffroy, earlier in 2023. Geffroy was taken off the project during a restructuring attempt at the studio, and with development still under wraps, it's unclear how much progress the game has made under Morel's guidance.",
          "It's worth pointing out that things seem to have been going better over the past couple of years. <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> devs expected cancellation back in 2021, but the production persevered and may have even hit its stride after Morel took over. Whether such optimism is displaced or not remains to be seen."

Viewers can get a glimpse of Reinhardt defending a group of soldiers from an omnic attack before the video shifts to a documentary 'talking heads' style approach.

        "article": [
          "<strong><em>Monster Hunter</em></strong> Now isn't expected to make money, Capcom has said. This unusual bit of insight into the upcoming title arrives mere weeks after <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> opened a new limited beta test ahead of its full-fledged release.",
          "Originally announced in April, <em>Monster Hunter</em> Now is an AR mobile game from <em>Pokemon GO</em> developer Niantic. Much like the studio's greatest hit to date, its <em>Monster Hunter</em> spin-off promises to combine geolocation-based exploration with action gameplay and resource collection.",
          "And while <em>Pokemon GO</em> isn't as popular as it used to be, the game still made billions of dollars over the past seven years, making Capcom's investors excited about the prospects of <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>. Yet the Japanese company insists that its primary motivation for licensing <em>Monster Hunter</em> to Niantic has nothing to do with the immediate money-making potential of such a move, having said as much during its latest general shareholder meeting. Asked about Capcom's expectations for <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, a company official revealed that the publisher primarily anticipates the game to boost the series' global brand instead of generate 'revenue contributions.'",
          "Capcom is not the first Japan-based gaming giant to adopt such a publicity-driven approach to mobile games. Back in December 2022, Nintendo also said its mobile games weren't meant to make money, with one of its officials claiming that titles like <em>Super Mario Run</em> and <em>Mario Kart</em> Tour were primarily developed as marketing tools. Yet that particular sentiment was expressed in defense of Nintendo's declining mobile profits, whereas Capcom seemingly adopted a similar perspective in order to preemptively downplay the commercial expectations for <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>.",
          "For clarity, Capcom is no stranger to mobile development, but most of its past efforts in this space were focused on ports of classic titles such as <em>Mega Man X</em> and the Ace Attorney games. Its latest <em>Monster Hunter</em> mobile game also followed that trend, having materialized in the form of the 2018 port of <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, formerly a 3DS exclusive. In contrast, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is Capcom's first contemporary attempt at putting out a mobile-only spin-off based on one of its massively popular franchises. So, irrespective of any commercial expectations attached to the project, the circumstances that led to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> still seem more akin to those surrounding <em>Pokemon GO</em> or even <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> than <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>.",
          "As for Capcom's other near-future plans, its latest shareholder meeting yielded a confirmation that the publisher isn't ruling out the possibility of remaking non-numbered <em>Resident Evil</em> games. A company representative also revealed that Capcom is currently looking into the possibility of reviving the Onimusha series."

One of the biggest Mythic Keystone complaints about Season 2 of <em>Dragonflight</em> has been the increased difficulty that healers have been dealing with, as the amount of total dungeon runs sunk well below expected numbers. Furthermore, the nerfs to off-spec hybrid healing that were planned for Patch 10.1.5 would have further introduced hardship for Mythic Keystone teams, despite tanks and damage dealers otherwise enjoying a smooth experience.",

Though players were hoping Dawn of the Infinite would be more of a progression experience, many fans were under the impression that the initial buffs made the megadungeon overtuned. The nerfs seem to specifically be targeting Chrono Lord Deios and the Blight of Galakrond bosses, practically halving the damage Galakrond can make with abilities such as Necrofrost, Corrosion, and Necrotic Winds.",
          "The changes were spotted and documented by Wowhead, and given that Fractures in Time is releasing on July 11, this may well be the final iteration of the upcoming megadungeon prior to launch. In addition to the latest changes, Dawn of the Infinite was previously hit by nerfs to Chronikar, Deios, and the Manifested Timeways, reducing the amount of healing required to endure the encounters. Though this fails to address the underlying issues that currently plague healers in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, it should make the initial version of the megadungeon a lot easier to stomach.",
          "Many community voices, whether popular streamers or casual players, have pointed towards Mythic Keystone healers in particular suffering from the nerfs, as spot healing continues to be in a bad spot ever since Embers of Neltharion launched. Though some <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/'><em>World of Warcraft</em></a> players have argued the difficulty of Mythic Keystones is at a good spot right now, it arguably comes at a great burden to healers, as opposed to spreading out the responsibility to tanks and damage dealers alike. Ultimately, many fans are hoping that the nerfs to Dawn of the Infinite will extend to Mythic Keystones proper, even if they have to wait till Season 3 to see it."

        "subTitle": "Bungie offers insight into Destiny 2's upcoming mid-season patch that will buff underutilized Exotics and struggling weapon archetypes.",
        "article": [
          "As per the latest Developer Insight by Bungie, several <strong><em>Destiny 2</em></strong> Exotic weapons and archetypes are set to receive significant buffs in the upcoming mid-season balance patch. Usually, major updates to weapon functionality and archetypes are reserved for the annual expansions or the beginning of a season. For a while, however, Bungie has begun rolling out a mid-season patch for <em>Destiny 2</em>, addressing any game-breaking bugs and glitches, underperforming weapons and Exotics, and much more to benefit player experience.",
          "Part of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s prolonged success as a looter shooter title can be attributed to the game's incredible combat system, seamlessly mixing gunplay and ability-based gameplay. From projectile weapons to energy cannons and bladed swords, <em>Destiny 2</em>'s massive arsenal offers players a ludicrous amount of choice when picking a favorite weapon. Exotic weapons hold a special place in <em>Destiny 2</em>'s combat landscape, coming equipped with special perks that are either perpetually active or triggered by completing specific actions, granting the weapon increased lethality, functionality, and synergy with other mechanics. While these weapons are quite capable on their own, the true potential is only realized when incorporated by players into thematic builds.",
          "Graviton Lance is one such Exotic Pulse Rifle that has remained relatively unchanged since the launch of <a><em>Destiny 2</em></a>, save for receiving a facelift with the Void 3.0 verbs added to its capabilities. In the latest Developer Insight, Bungie has stated that Graviton Lance will receive an additional 67% buff against PvE targets to balance its lethality compared to other Exotic Pulse Rifles. It's not all buffs, however, as the damage from the Cosmology explosions has been decreased by 40% in PvP only, as well as removing the aim assist from the catalyst. As for other Exotics, the No Time To Explain Pulse Rifle has received a nerf to its effective range, and Fighting Lion's Exotic perk has been restored to its full functionality.",
          "The mid-season patch has several changes in store for many weapon archetypes to compensate for the ever-changing meta of <em>Destiny 2</em>. Pulse Rifles, especially the High-Impact subfamily, will receive a boost in their auto-aim angle at lower aim assist ranges. The effective range for Lightweight Bows has been increased at all tiers, alongside a buff to final accuracy by nearly 10%. The dynamic reticle for Submachine Guns has been reworked to offer players more visual clarity during combat. Finally, Lightweight Shotguns will have tighter pellet spread in longer ranges, increasing the lethality in PvP. Post-patch, the Gutshot Straight and Slickdraw perks will have reduced auto-aim penalty, while the infamous Target Lock perk will only offer a 25% damage boost in PvP instead of the current 40%.",
          "These upcoming changes reflect the changes coming to Destiny 2's weapons, but the developers have promised that changes to other aspects are in the works for the mid-season patch. The Developer Insight states that these changes will help Bungie bring more significant changes to <em>Destiny 2</em> in the future."

        "article": [
          "Before <strong><em>Genshin Impact</em></strong>'s Version 3.8 update has officially launched, leaks are already hinting at the lineup of four-star characters set to feature on the new patch's second half banners. Since the launch of <a href='https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-hoyoverse-revenue-2022/'>the massively successful HoYoverse RPG</a> in late 2020, the game's roster has more than tripled in size with nearly 70 playable characters available as of Version 3.7's launch. With new characters added almost every patch, the roster has continued to grow with more members adding unique playstyles. Version 3.8, however, is set to buck a longstanding trend for the RPG.",
          "With the Version 3.8 Special Program for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/genshin-impact/'><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> airing late last week, HoYoverse would confirm a major break from the norm for the final Sumeru update. Version 3.8 was confirmed to only feature re-runs of past characters with no new members added for the first time in the game's history. While the roster will not welcome any new additions, several popular characters including Klee, Sangonomiya Kokomi, and Wanderer were confirmed for re-runs during the update. Now, new leaks have hinted at the four-star banner characters for Version 3.8's second half.",
          "An update shared by <em>Genshin Impact</em> leaker Genshin Universe revealed the four-star characters set to join Wanderer and Kokomi during the second banners of Version 3.8. Version 3.8's second half is set to feature four-stars from three different nations with Sumeru four-star Faruzan, Liyue four-star Yanfei, and Mondstadt four-star Rosaria. The featured four-star character lineup is nearly identical to Wanderer's initial release in Version 3.3, only swapping Gorou out for Rosaria. Wanderer and Kokomi's banners are expected to debut in late July, three weeks after Version 3.8's launch.",
          "<h2>Genshin Impact Version 3.8 Second Half Banner Characters</h2><ul> <li> Wanderer: five-star Anemo Catalyst character </li> <li> Kokomi: five-star Hydro Catalyst character </li> <li> Faruzan: four-star Anemo Catalyst character </li> <li> Yanfei: four-star Pyro Catalyst character </li> <li> Rosaria: four-star Cryo Polearm character </li> </ul>",
          "The featured characters, as is typical for <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s banners, boast exceptional synergy with the limited five-star characters available. Faruzan has often been a staple of team compositions built around Wanderer, providing powerful Anemo Res shredding effects and boosting allies' Anemo damage. When fully built, Rosaria can also provide powerful buffs for Physical damage-focused characters like Eula, with her 4th Ascension Passive buffing allies' Crit Rate and her C6 passive adding Physical Res shred to her Elemental Burst.",
          "While Version 3.8 is not set to feature any new playable characters, the update will bring plenty of new content to close out <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s Sumeru cycle. The new version will see players whisked away to a new limited-time region with several new mini-games and sub-events. Two of Genshin Impact's oldest characters will also be receiving skins as part of the new update with both Klee and Kaeya sporting new looks for the event. HoYoverse is set to finish the Sumeru region's patch cycle with a bang as the developer prepares for the upcoming addition of Fontaine."

          "A new video for <strong><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></strong> shows Jingliu's gameplay, giving players an idea of what the upcoming character will look like on the battlefield. <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/'><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> is still new compared to its <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em> and <em>Genshin Impact</em>, but HoYoverse's title has followed the same successful path as its 'big brothers,' mainly thanks to its cast of characters.",
          "Honkai: Star Rail currently has 22 playable characters, or 24 if one counts the Trailblazer versions. This list keeps expanding. Since it's a gacha RPG, HoYoverse regularly brings new characters to <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. One example is the trio Kafka, Blade, and Luka, who have already been officially announced and should appear in version 1.2 of the game. Meanwhile, <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s leaks bring new information about potential characters almost every day.",
          "Reddit user Administrative_Ad432 shared a video revealing the gameplay for Jingliu, one of the most anticipated characters for <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> players. Although not officially announced, Jingliu is coming to Honkai: Star Rail, with several leaks bringing information about the 5-star character. The <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail_leaks/comments/14jcgth/jingliu_gameplay_ult_unfinished/'>nearly three-minute video shared by Administrative_Ad432</a> shows Jingliu in her two versions, the first where the character wears a blindfold and uses her basic attack and skill version along with her standby stance. Jingliu's face becomes fully visible when she enters the Transcendence state and removes the blindfold.",
          "In addition to assuming a new standby stance, Jingliu in the Transcendence state has a skill that consumes two stacks instead of one, gaining a flashier animation than before. The video also shows Jingliu's ultimate, and while players cannot see a complete animation, it is possible to get a general sense of what it will look like. While battling alongside the new <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> character Luocha, the video emphasizes that Jingliu is still heavily under development, so most of her animations and abilities are broken or unfinished.",
          "The Jingliu gameplay leak has made <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> players even more eager for the character. Jingliu is a powerful character with an important history in the game's universe, having been Jing Yuan's mentor when he first started joining the ranks of the Cloud Knights. Jingliu will be voiced by actress AmaLee, known for her work in anime such as <em>My Dress-Up Darling</em> and <em>Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card</em>."

        "article": [
          "During the recent <strong><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></strong> stress test, players were able to put the game through its paces and discover some previously unannounced features like the Quitality. After months of speculation with many fans assuming the next game from NetherRealm Studio would be <em>Mortal Kombat 12</em>, Ed Boon and the development team surprised just about everyone by introducing a rebooted franchise with Mortal Kombat 1.",
          "In this new timeline, Fire God Liu Kang has reshaped the world and everyone in it, sometimes for the more surprising as classic rivals Sub-Zero and Scorpion are now brothers. Alongside a brand-new story, <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> features plenty of new mechanics such as Kameo fighters that can be called upon during a match to assist the player with throws, counters, combo extenders, and even Fatalities. However, players have also begun discovering previously unannounced features that are making a comeback as well.",
          "The first stress test for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/mortal-kombat-1/'>Mortal Kombat 1</a> gave many players their first opportunity to go hands on with the game, exploring the limited roster of characters and Kameo fighters. It also gave players the chance to mess around with the various '-ality' systems in the game such as the iconic fatality moves to put a fluorish on a match victory. However, players also began to discover that the Quitality mechanic has also returned for this latest iteration.",
          "Originally introduced in 2015's <em>Mortal Kombat X</em>, Quitalities result during online Mortal Kombat matches when one player decides to leave mid-match. Not only does the other player get the victory, but their opponent's character explodes to some degree suddenly to cap of the match. Players, like FGC community member Ketchup, have been discovering all of the new gory animations added to <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> as players exit matches before the end of the round.",
          "Even as the first <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> comes to a close, it appears to have been a big success for NetherRealm Studios with a high demand from fans. In fact, it was in such high demand, that it even caught the attention of scalpers who posted <em>MK1</em> stress test access keys online for ridiculous prices. On sites like eBay, codes were being sold for a variety of prices ranging from $180 to over $800."

        "subTitle": "A newly emerged Resident Evil 4 update hints at an imminent release of DLC for Capcom's hit survival horror remake.",
        "article": [
          "A new piece of DLC for <strong><em>Resident Evil 4</em></strong> could be releasing in the immediate future, as suggested by a newly emerged update to the Steam version of the game. While Capcom has yet to confirm it intends to put out more post-launch content for the hit remake, some recently datamined Resident Evil 4 files have already pointed to the return of Separate Ways, a fan-favorite story mode.",
          "Two weeks into its release, the Resident Evil 4 remake received its first free DLC in the form of the Mercenaries mode. The move left Separate Ways as the only major piece of content from the 2005 original that's still missing from the 2023 remake.",
          "And while the Japanese developer hasn't yet confirmed that Separate Ways is actually on its way to the game, the Steam version of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> has just been updated with seven new achievements, indicating that a major content drop is on the horizon. Five of the newly added trophies are hidden, while the remaining two have placeholder names that don't reveal anything about their prerequisites or the game itself. Seeing how Separate Ways added an extensive campaign starring Ada Wong to the original game, a new version of this lengthy mode could easily account for such a significant increase in the total number of the <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake's achievements, which now stands at 46.",
          "This development dovetails with a recent Resident Evil 4 leak narrowing down the release date of the Separate Ways DLC, which suggested that the much-rumored addition will at the very least be revealed—if not released—in the second half of 2023. And while that's looking extremely plausible following this update to the game's list of achievements, what's still unclear is whether Capcom intends to charge fans for the privilege of experiencing the story of <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>from Ada Wong's perspective.",
          "Although the Mercenaries mode was released for free, the scope of Separate Ways is much closer to the likes of the Winters' Expansion for <em>Resident Evil Village</em> and <em>Resident Evil 7</em>'s End of Zoe, both of which released as paid DLC. Meanwhile, Capcom's previous two <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes didn't receive extensive post-launch support that would offer direct points of comparison; they both featured paid cosmetics, but so does <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, and such content isn't comparable to an ambitious expansion that would boost its respective game's number of achievements by 20%.",
          "It's hence possible that Capcom will opt to release Separate Ways as paid DLC. And while the expansion's business model is still unclear, what's certain is that Separate Ways will offer an entirely new perspective on the events of the <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/resident-evil-4-remake/'><em>Resident Evil 4 remake</em></a>."

          "The open beta for <strong><em>MultiVersus</em></strong> has officially shut down, but this isn't the end for the platform fighter. Warner Bros. Interactive's dive into the fighting genre has experienced an extensive open beta period, but the official closing of <em>MultiVersus</em>' beta signals a new chapter for the game.",
          "Released back in 2022, <em>MultiVersus</em> followed the path of <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. by pitting iconic Warner Bros. characters against one another in fun platform-based fighting matches. Although the game launched to a positive start, the player count for Multiversus dwindled since its release. With the falling player count, it seemed that the open beta had served its initial purpose of giving players a sneak peek. This decrease in interaction from fans was eventually followed by an announcement back in March that the open beta would be closing on June 25th. Despite the beta closing its doors, there is a still a future for <em>MultiVersus</em> that fans of the brawler title can look forward to.",
          "<em>MultiVersus</em> is set to return sometime in the first half of 2024, leaving some players eagerly waiting its eventual return. The game featured Warner Bros. characters ranging from Batman to Jake and Finn from <em>Adventure Time</em>, and the game's downtime will likely see developers fine-tuning both characters and combat in order to give players a great brawling experience when < href='https://gamerant.com/tag/multiversus/'><em>MultiVersus</em></> returns. Although it may frustrate some players that there isn't an official date for the game's 2024 launch, there are still ways fans will be able to enjoy the game.",
          "Those who have installed the game can still fight in local matches and use the training room, but all the online content will no longer be available. There are some who fear that this beta closure could be a bad move for <em>MultiVersus</em>, but all hope is not lost for the game. This beta closure could actually rile up excitement again. Absence sometimes makes the heart grow fonder, so it could possibly help the game's 2024 relaunch.",
          "Whether this beta closure helps the game's future or not, only time will tell. The positive response from many who played the beta during its initial release proves that the game has something to offer a specific audience. Until the game relaunches, there are alternatives to <em>MultiVersus</em> while it's on hiatus, and those titles could help inspire gamers to have a renewed sense of excitement for the game's relaunch. The future of <em>MultiVersus</em> is filled with unknowns, but a potential strong comeback in 2024 could give gamers a new favorite brawler to play."

        "article": [
          "A resourceful <strong><em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></strong> gamer has managed to create a working scale to measure Link’s weight. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> players are constantly inventing gadgets using the game’s extensive building systems, and this scale is definitely among the most creative ones so far.",
          "Ever since its release back in May, <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> has been a huge hit. The game was able to sell over 10 million units in the first three days, and it continued to maintain its popularity as weeks passed. Part of why gamers love the new <em>Zelda</em> so much is due to how big and packed with interesting content the open world is. Often, this can lead to some pretty interesting interactions, especially when using the new Fuse and Ultrahand abilities, which are at the heart of the game’s building system.",
          "Now, a <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/tears-of-the-kingdom/'><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> gamer was able to invent a working scale. RecommendationOk6842 recently shared a video showing their latest creation: a scale that could be used to weigh several objects in the game or even the protagonist Link himself. The device was quite simple, using real-life principles that would apply to a scale, such as having two platforms that would be weighed against each other and using gravity to do the rest of the work. Hilariously, when the gamer weighed Link, they discovered that Hyrule’s hero was just as heavy as five apples. So, either Link is very light, or the apples in the game are incredibly heavy.",
          "People in the comments of the Reddit post were already finding some cool ways to employ this scale. For instance, Doubting_Gamer had the idea of using the object to measure the lightest items which could be used to build flying devices in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. However, the game is still lacking an official measurement unit, so players were already discussing whether the official unit should be measured in apples or bananas, for instance.",
          "<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> gamers continue to express their creativity and resourcefulness in many ways with Nintendo’s latest hit, and there are many other interesting examples of that. For instance, one <em>Zelda</em> player created a working lawnmower recently, completely automating the task of cutting grass. While the invention still needed a few tweaks to be perfect, it was a fine example of how creative players can be in Nintendo’s latest title."

Besides naming their characters and outfitting them with various gear and cosmetics, players can also select from a variety of titles to give their <em>Diablo 4</em> character extra flair.",

Some <em>Diablo 4</em> titles are sought out by the community, with many fans wanting to add 'The' to their list of available titles. Since titles are made up of a Prefix and Suffix, it makes sense that many <em>Diablo 4</em> players want 'The' as part of their title roster.",
          "Blizzard's Rod Fergusson acknowledged that many <em>Diablo 4</em> players are looking to add 'The' to their title choices, and so he revealed that it's unlocked by completing all the Bear Tribe side quests in Fractured Peaks. These side quests are found in Bear Tribe Refuge, which is an area players will likely visit fairly early in their <em>Diablo 4</em> adventures. Upon completing all the side quests, players will unlock two titles: 'The' and 'Bear.'",
          "The last side quest <em>Diablo 4</em> players will have to complete at Bear Tribe Refuge is called 'Call of the Ancients', and there is a glitch associated with it that fans should be aware of if they're hoping to unlock the 'The' title. If one's co-op partner is dead when they down the boss at the end of the Call of the Ancients quest, the objective will get stuck and players will have to redo the quest from the start. This bug is avoided by making sure everyone is up and revived before killing the boss.",
          "It's possible Blizzard will fix this bug in a future update, but plans to that effect have not actually been announced at the time of this writing. <em>Diablo</em> fans do know that a sizable update is coming to the game between now and when Season 1 launches in mid-July that will make various adjustments and add quality of life improvements. Blizzard is planning to support <em>Diablo 4</em> for quite some time to come, so fans can look forward to many more updates in the months ahead."

        "article": [
          "A <strong><em>Diablo 4</em></strong> Player has used the game’s transmog system to create <em>Elden Ring</em>’s Starscourage Radahn in the game. <em>Diablo 4</em> was eagerly anticipated and did not disappoint after its recent release. The open-world RPG allows players to customize their characters to their liking. One of the ways <em>Diablo 4</em> gives players ultimate control over the style of their characters is with a transmog system.",
          "<em>Diablo 4</em>'s transmog system allows players to retain the stats of a particular piece of armor without having to wear that specific piece. It’s an option included in many RPGs that allows fashion-conscious players to customize their character’s looks as they see fit without sacrificing function. In essence, if a particular piece of armor looks good on the player’s character, but a different set has better stats, the player can use the stats of the better set while wearing the better-looking one.",
          "A <em>Diablo 4</em> fan named Broken_Mau23 in the game’s subreddit used the transmog system to deck out their character in an armor set that closely resembles the set worn by Starscourge Radahn from <em>Elden Ring</em>. Radahn’s armor set is comprised of ornate yet tarnished silver and gold plates trimmed with fur. The color of the metals is offset by the blood-red mane of hair streaming off the top of his helmet. Broken_Mau23 found a suitable stand-in for the iconic helmet with <em>Diablo 4</em>’s Zischagge helm. While Radanh’s chest piece is perhaps a bit too ornate for what <em>Diablo 4</em> has to offer, Broken_Mau23 used the Warlord Plate, which comes with bulky decorative shoulder pads that come close to mimicking Radahn’s more extravagant armor.",
          "For the legs, the crafty <em>Diablo 4</em> player used Strider’s Handwraps. While not quite like Radahn’s silver and gold gauntlets, the handwraps are of a similar enough color and tone. For the legs, they used the Sand-Worn Breeches, which are perhaps the piece of armor in <em>Diablo 4</em> that most closely resembles Radahn’s armor.",
          "Radahn was one of the most fearsome and difficult bosses in <em>Elden Ring</em> before he was nerfed in an early patch to make him less difficult. Still, his visual style is an aspect that fans latched onto. One piece of Radahn iconography that is missing, however, is the same piece that made a lot of fans fall in love with him: his horse, Leonard. Radahn’s uses his powers of levitation to stay atop his beloved yet undersized horse without crushing it. While <em>Diablo 4</em> does have horses and even horse armor, it is unlikely that Blizzard will include a tiny, scrawny horse like Leonard anytime soon."

          "In addition to the controversies surrounding the game’s setting and some of its content, the single-player first-person shooter also shipped with a lot of bugs that hampered gameplay. Mundfish has since released regular updates to iron out many of the issues, while also teasing the upcoming <em>Atomic Heart</em> DLC, which up till now only had a release window.",
          "“Annihilation Instinct,” the long-awaited DLC for <em>Atomic Heart</em> will be launching on August 2, 2023, for all platforms. The story picks up where the events of <em>Atomic Heart</em> left off, and a new trailer and its description have revealed that there will be new shape-shifting enemies in the <em>Atomic Heart</em> DLC for protagonist P-3 to take on. Players will also venture into the swamps surrounding a new location, the Mendeleev Complex, which is apparently still part of Facility 3826, where the main game takes place.",
          "Additionally, Annihilation Instinct will introduce two new weapons to <em>Atomic Heart</em>: the Secateur, which looks like a kind of energy rifle of a size similar to the Dominator, and the Klusha, which resembles a two-handed polearm-type melee weapon. P-3 also still has his glove and will gain a new Techno-Stasis ability that allows him to manipulate time.",
          "This new glove power complements the theme of the Annihilation Instinct DLC, which seems to center around uncovering the truth about NORA, the talkative vending machine that’s used to upgrade weapons and unlock new skills in <em>Atomic Heart</em>. The DLC will also bring back NPCs from the main game and introduce a new “enigmatic” character.",
          "For those who enjoy the game and don’t think a DLC will be enough, Mundfish recently released a New Game+ mode with Update 1.8.0.0, which gives enemies new abilities to watch out for. For example, the VOV-A6 Lab Tech, the mustachioed robot, will be immune to glove abilities and cartridge weapons while also enjoying increased attack and movement speeds. The developer has revealed that an <em>Atomic Heart</em> sequel is already in the works as well, though further details about that project may be a long time coming."

          "<strong>Bungie</strong> is already hard at work with the ongoing support of <em>Destiny 2</em> and upcoming reboot of <em>Marathon</em>, but it appears the studio's third new IP may not be as far as some players may be thinking if a new report is correct. News on the third IP, known only as Matter following a 2018 trademark filing, has been fairly light in 2023 as the studio focuses on its two known titles. However, this new information does not come directly from <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/bungie/'>Bungie</a>, but instead from the current legal litigation embroiling Microsoft's proposal to acquire Activision Blizzard.",
          "Destiny 2's current season, Season of the Deep, sees the return of Titan to the Sol System after its disappearance at the launch of 2020's <em>Beyond Light</em> expansion. Guardians have been summoned to the moon at the request of Deputy Commander Sloane, who is requesting aid to protect a creature living beneath the methane waves which may have valuable information about The Witness. However, the Hive god Xivu Arath is also making her presence in the system known more directly as her forces work to stop Sloane's plans for the creature.",
          "Despite the near constant support required for <em>Destiny 2</em> and development of the new <em>Marathon</em>, new documents from Microsoft's FTC hearings suggest <em>Matter</em> could be releasing sometime in 2025. The hearing documents specifically contain an evaluation of Bungie done by Microsoft in 2021, outlining some of the studio's plans at the time for expansion and game support. It points out how the studio 'has more than doubled its headquarter space' and was set to open its first international office in Amsterdam in 2022, the latter of which would focus on <em>Destiny 2</em> support and development of <em>Matter</em>.",
          "The internal evaluation by Microsoft lines up with additional reports suggesting the tech giant was interested in acquiring Bungie, along with Sega, in 2020. By that time, the studio was known to be working on a new IP, <em>Matter</em>, and had received a $100 million investment Chinese tech company NetEase to go toward the new project. Updates became few and far between following this news, though it has been confirmed the <em>Marathon</em> reboot is an entirely different project from the third IP.",
          "Since the time of the evaluation, Bungie has seen quite a few changes occur on the business side as the studio is no longer independent. Sony completed its acquisition of the studio for roughly $3.6 billion in July 2022, joining a roster of first-party studios which include Sucker Punch and Insomniac. It also remains to be seen if the 2025 release window in the 2021 evaluation remains accurate, or if the new IP may be further off than players think."

        "subTitle": "A member of the Alan Wake 2 development team has spoken out in defense of the game's fast approaching digital-only release later this year.",
        "article": [
          "Some fans are disappointed that there will not be a physical release for <strong><em>Alan Wake 2</em></strong>, and the developer has now revealed the logic behind the decision. There has been some discourse around digital-only releases for AAA games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, with many fans being concerned by what appears to be a growing trend with big-league developers.",
          "Some of the main concerns around digital-only releases are well-established. Somewhat ironically, the original <em>Alan Wake</em> was pulled from digital storefronts for over a year due to music licensing issues. While it was eventually made available once everything was ironed out, the fact remains that nobody could buy <em>Alan Wake</em> for 17 months. Game collectors and preservationists are generally outspoken about the importance of physical releases; there is always a possibility that a digital storefront will be closed at some point, and physical releases are a way of ensuring that a game is available to play if this ever happens.",
          "Kyle Rowley, the game director for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/alan-wake-2/'><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, has defended the digital-only release of the game. In an interview with Eurogamer, Rowley explains that taking the digital-only release route allows the team 'more time to polish the game' and explains that the game that goes on a physical release would need to be playable without a patch several weeks ahead of launch. This is termed 'going gold', which refers to a version of a game (the 'gold master' version) that the publisher deems complete and ready to ship. By skipping out on this step and going with a digital-only release, Remedy can essentially keep working on <em>Alan Wake 2</em> until the day it launches.",
          "There are a few ways fans of <em>Alan Wake</em> can look at this news. The first one is in the light of optimism; it certainly would be remiss if <em>Alan Wake 2</em> was immortalized on a physical medium in an unplayable state, and it would also be in poor taste to ship a physical copy of the game that is little more than a DRM key on a disc. Remedy has done well to temper fans' expectations, but Rowley's words might exacerbate some concerns about <em>Alan Wake 2</em> after its Summer Game Fest trailer was a little light on gameplay.",
          "It could be that digital-only releases are becoming a third option for developers who are deciding between releasing a game that they don't feel is ready or delaying it. That said, the developers of <em>Alan Wake 2</em> have spoken confidently about their work in the context of its October release, with the month typically being saturated with exciting horror releases in the build-up to Halloween."

        "article": [
          "<strong><em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></strong> just released its biggest Unearthed Arcana playtest packet in its long history. This massive document includes revisions for multiple classes, subclasses, spells, feats, and other <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/dungeons-and-dragons/'><em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a> rules.",
          "Wizards of the Coast is in the process of revising <em>5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons</em> to become an evergreen system. This initiative, called <em>One D&D</em>, has involved rigorous playtesting via Unearthed Arcana documents full of revised rules and new content.",
          "Its most recent Unearthed Arcana packet is its biggest one yet. This 77-page document includes tons of revisions, many of which build upon previous playtests and surveys. Several spell lists, spells, and feats have received continued tweaks in an effort to improve the game, and Weapon Mastery from the last <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> playtest has been refined and expanded to other classes. Additionally, seven full classes appear in the document, including Monk–the only one not published in an Unearthed Arcana yet.",
          "Here are some of the biggest changes each <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> class received:",
          "<ul> <li> Bards can now use spell slots when they run out of Bardic Inspiration, have more freedom in what spells they learn, and have a powerful capstone ability called Words of Creation. </li> <li> Clerics now always have the Commune spell prepared, can deal damage with Turn Undead, and can cast the Wish spell using Greater Divine Intervention. </li> <li> Druid Wildshapes changes have been partially reverted, but all Druids can transform as a bonus action and can improve their Wildshape attacks or cantrips with Elemental Fury. </li> <li> Monk Martial Arts dice scale from a d6 to a d12, but only affect unarmed strikes. Additionally, several Monk abilities are renamed and reworked, and they have a new capstone called Defy Death. </li> <li> Paladins can now use Lay on Hands as a bonus action, and Divine Smite has been reworked into a series of Paladin-only spells. </li> <li> <a href='https://gamerant.com/dungeons-dragons-5e-best-ranger-builds/'>Rangers gain iconic <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a> spells like Hunter’s Mark and Conjure Barrage for free, and have an improved version of Foe Slayer as a final ability. </li> <li> Rogues can reduce their sneak attack damage to inflict conditions and maneuver around the battlefield with Cunning Strike and Devious Strikes. </li> </ul>",
          "Additionally, the two classes received two never-before-seen subclasses: the College of Dance Bard and the Circle of the Sea Druid. The College of Dance gives the Bard powerful support abilities reminiscent of a Monk, and the Circle of the Sea grants Druids abilities to navigate the skies and the oceans and to control the battlefield cold, lightning, and thunder damage. If these subclasses are printed, players can expect them in the revised <em>5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook</em> planned for 2024."

        "article": [
          "Valve's <strong>Steam Deck</strong> is now on sale at a discounted rate as part of this year's Steam Summer Sale. The company's gaming hardware has been a hit among gamers since its debut last year, with many titles ranging from <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to Hi-Fi Rush supporting the Steam Deck. As its latest Steam sale kicks off, Valve is seemingly looking to capitalize on the Steam Deck's appeal.",
          "Of course, it's no surprise that the Steam Deck continues to be a popular choice among many gamers. Customers had to wait eight months to order the device without reservations thanks to challenges in meeting demands with sufficient supply. The Steam Deck reportedly crossed a million units around October 2022. By early March, Valve's internal research indicated that about 42% of Steam Deck owners prefer gaming on the device as compared to other platforms.",
          "Following this growing appeal, Valve has put up the <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/steam-deck/'>Steam Deck</a> for sale alongside the slew of discounted games at the latest Steam Summer Sale. While Valve previously offered the Steam Deck on sale back in March, gamers rarely get the opportunity to get a hold of the handheld device at a discounted rate. This means interested buyers can now grab the 64GB base model at a 10% discount for $359.10 whereas the 256GB model ships 15% off at $449.65. Additionally, gamers can buy the 512GB Steam Deck for $519.20, which is $129.80 off its usual pricing. The cheaper offering will be available for purchase on the Steam Store from 29 June to 13 July.",
          "While the hardware's popularity continues, Valve is also actively investing in its software improvements. Recently, the company unveiled a notable visual overhaul to the Steam desktop client that affected its font, notifications, and download tab among other areas. Of course, the updated UI made its way to mobile and Steam Deck as well. Additionally, the changes included a refreshed in-game overlay for desktop users along with a new Notes feature that was previously available in a Steam beta client version.",
          "As of now, it remains to be seen if Valve will choose to offer the Steam Deck at discounted rates anytime soon following the Steam Summer Sale. Although, it's safe to assume the company may have plans for another Steam Deck sale during the year, particularly considering the slew of Steam sale events in 2023. Regardless, this would come as welcome news to PC gamers who have been considering a viable handheld option like the <strong>Steam Deck</strong>. As to how far its appeal carries through for Valve in the months, if not years to come, only time will tell."

        "article": [
          "Voice actor Luke Roberts, who will play James Sunderland in the <strong><em>Silent Hill 2</em></strong> remake, has seemingly hinted at the long-awaited title's release date. Rumors indicate that the <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake is close to completion, but this hint indicates players have a small wait on their hands yet.",
          "It's been an incredible few years for fans of horror remakes. Capcom has had an enormous amount of success remaking its iconic <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, with each title received brilliantly. The hope is that Konami and Bloober Team can recreate that same success with <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/silent-hill/'>Silent Hill 2</a>. While the franchises are certainly different in many ways, there's no denying that there's a significant overlap in player base there. In many ways, Capcom has done the leg work by getting gamers excited about horror again, and teed up the ball for Bloober Team perfectly. Now all the studio has to do is hit <em>Silent Hill 2</em> out of the park.",
          "The news comes from the video game forum ResetEra, where a user allegedly direct messaged Roberts on Instagram asking when <em>Silent Hill 2</em> was set to be released. His response was a short but sweet 'Early next year I believe...' Just a few weeks ago, a release date of September 29 leaked for the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, contradicting Roberts' message here. It should be said that this date came from an online website, where placeholder dates are often used in lieu of actual release dates. If the message from Luke Roberts is real, players should be inclined to believe him, as the actor for the game's protagonist should probably have some inkling of when it will release.",
          "Despite the date being later than many might have expected, it does make sense. Since the Silent Hill 2 remake was first announced with a trailer in October 2022, there has yet to be any official marketing for the game from Bloober Team. If it was to be released this year as many fans had speculated, a greater marketing push would probably have been expected by now. Of course, no two games are the same, and the developer could simply be taking a different approach, but a release this year is becoming increasingly unlikely.",
          "No matter when the game releases, it's just good to see <em>Silent Hill</em> rise from the dead. The last release in the series was <em>Silent Hill: Downpour</em>, which came all the way back in 2012. After nothing came of <em>P.T.</em> back in 2014, gamers could be forgiven for thinking <em>Silent Hill</em>'s hiatus was a permanent one. But with <em>Silent Hill F</em> on the way in the future too, it seems as though Konami is all in on <em>Silent Hill</em> once more."

A year later, Crash returned in <em>Crash Bandicoot: On the Run</em>, an endless runner mobile game published and developed by <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> studio King.",
          "A third <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> game was announced after months of speculation during The Game Awards 2022 last December. <em>Titled Crash Team Rumble</em>, this online multiplayer game features Crash and his colorful cast of supporting characters battling it out across various tropical landscapes to see who can collect the most Wumpa Fruit in frantic 4v4 skirmishes. Reviews for <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> have been generally mixed so far, with some criticizing the game’s monetization and others praising its smooth controls.",
          "Twitch users might have a more resoundingly negative opinion though, as <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/crash-team-rumble/'><em>Crash Team Rumble</em></a> is currently underperforming in terms of livestream views. As reported by VideoGamer, <em>Crash Team Rumble</em>’s Twitch numbers have dropped to less than 30 viewers. In comparison, other recently released multiplayer titles include <em>Street Fighter 6</em> at 19k viewers, <em>BattleBit Remastered</em> at 14k spectators, and F1 23 at 3.5k viewers.",
          "Releasing <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> around the same time as these other blockbuster multiplayer games might have contributed to its lackluster Twitch performance, and the rest of 2023 is filled with even more notable games. Activision’s minimal promotion for <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> may have also hurt it, as many fans on social media have expressed surprise that a new <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> game was released last week.",
          "There is still plenty of time for <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> to gain traction on Twitch, especially since developer Toys for Bob is already hinting at additional playable characters being introduced in the near future alongside the expected quality-of-life refinements. However, the rest of 2023 is looking pretty stacked, and <em>Crash Team Rumble</em>’s lower-than-average Twitch numbers are not a promising sign of success for the colorful yet divisive online multiplayer battle royale."

        "article": [
          "The PC release of the highly anticipated <strong><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></strong> is being moved forward, while the PS5 version is getting pushed back just a few days. It's been over 20 years since the last mainline installment in the beloved RPG franchise, and <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3/'><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a> will be looking to capture a new generation of RPG fans.",
          "<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, officially announced in 2019, had previously stamped a release date for August 31 of this year. As it's been such a long wait for <em>Baldur's Gate</em> fans since the first two BioWare-developed titles, the excitement surrounding this massive third installment has been palpable. 2023 has been a behemoth year for video game releases with legendary, long-established franchises dropping massive mainline installments like <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>. As the upcoming Fall season of games isn't intent on slowing down, Larian Studios has had to adjust its landing for <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.",
          "In a community update on Steam, <em>Baldur's Gate</em> announced it's moving its PC release date forward almost a whole month to August 3, and that the PS5 version will see a slight delay to September 6. In speaking with IGN, <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> director and studio founder Swen Vincke cites the business of 2023's competitive release calendar, pointing to massive titles that have recently been released like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, as well as the imminent <em>Starfield</em>, which serves as direct competition to <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> as a western RPG, even more so now with <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s PS5 version landing on <em>Starfield</em>'s release day.",
          "According to Larian, the purpose of shifting the PC version of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> forward to August 3 was to give gamers a better opportunity to spend time with the game before other big RPG competitors like <em>Starfield</em> launch in the Fall. Holding firm on that August 31 release date would mean Larian would be launching its game one day before <em>Starfield</em>'s early access period begins on September 1. This decision may seem sound in a vacuum, but seeing that Larian is simultaneously pushing the PS5 version of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> onto <em>Starfield</em>'s exact release day seems questionable. However, Vincke clarified that this daring move was made for the purpose of the team having extra time to make sure it hits its 60 FPS performance target on PS5.",
          "While it's true that <em>Baldur's Gate 3 </em>and <em>Starfield</em> are two RPGs of different settings, one fantasy and one sci-fi, Larian knows that there are still many gamers wanting to dive into both of them. It's incredibly rare to see a studio thinking about its playerbase's time like this and making schedule changes to ensure its fans have the time to play what they want.

        "article": [
          "<strong>Bloober Team</strong>, the game developer behind the upcoming <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and <em>Layers of Fear</em>, has recently confirmed that the studio is now done with psychological horror games, and will focus on mass-market horror in the future. Bloober Team is known for making some of the best psychological horror games out there, so it’s a controversial decision, to say the least.",
          "Last year, it was announced that Bloober Team would remake <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, perhaps the most beloved entry in Konami’s horror franchise. <em>Silent Hill 2</em> was known for its unique take on psychological horror before it was something common, and the game stood out among similar survival horror games of its time due to its unnerving atmosphere and a focus on the protagonist’s mental state. Bloober Team seems like a great fit for the remake exactly because of the studio’s experience with creating similar horror experiences.",
          "Now, Piotr Babieno, the CEO of the studio, revealed in an interview with Engadget that the recent release of the Layers of Fear remake was the swan song of the company’s classic style of making games. Babieno described the old style of the game as focusing on story, mood, and vibes, but not giving a lot of attention to the mechanics of the game. Now, the studio will transform into what is known as “Bloober Team 3.0” internally, and move towards a more mass-market-oriented horror design, making bigger titles that will have a lot of gameplay mechanics.",
          "Babieno also confirmed that the upcoming remake of Konami’s horror franchise will be the first time <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/bloober-team/'>Bloober Team</a> will test out its new philosophy. This could mean that the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake will prioritize gameplay over the “vibes,” or only that the company is ready to give it more polish and make the gameplay feel better than the other titles it has put out before.",
          "While it’s impossible to say if this shift in the studio’s strategy is bad news for the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake or a good move forward, one developer believes that it’ll be hard to develop the game anyway. In a recent interview, Sam Barlow, who worked on the remake of the first title of the franchise, <em>Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</em>, said that the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is a poison chalice. After all, the job of reimagining such a classic horror game won’t be easy, and some fans will always be left unsatisfied."

        "article": [
          "Remedy Entertainment has revealed that <strong><em>Alan Wake 2</em></strong>'s combat will have a slower pace compared to the original game. According to Co-Director Sam Lake, <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/alan-wake-2/'><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a> will have a slower combat pace to be closer to survival horror.",
          "Despite its horror setting, <em>Alan Wake</em> always had a more action-like approach to combat. The game featured fast-paced shooting sections in which the protagonist had to shake off hordes of enemies using the power of a flashlight and a gun. While the original had fast-paced combat encounters, they don't fit well in the survival-horror genre.",
          "Because of this, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s pace will be 'slowed down' compared to the first game. Co-Director Sam Lake mentioned in the latest issue of PLAY Magazine that the game will feature less combat as <em>Alan Wake 2</em> shifts to survival horror genre. According to Sam Lake, the combat in <em>Alan Wake</em> was very 'samey' and shifting to survival horror was an approach that 'made a lot of sense'. The slower combat will allow players to have more meaningful encounters and make a bigger event out of every fight.",
          "This contrast in combat encounters found in <em>Alan Wake 2</em> can be felt from the very first gameplay trailer, as enemies looked to be a lot tougher compared to the previous game. With Sam Lake's comments in mind, this approach makes much more sense as the game focuses on making the enemy density lower compared to the original game. 'The first game was an action adventure game – it had horror elements, but it was an action adventure game. And there were elements there that we wanted to fix, if you will – the fact that the combat is very samey and there is a lot of it through the whole experience. [...] Less combat, the pacing is slowed down – it allows us to be more ambitious with the story.'",
          "<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s atmosphere was the most prominent feature during the Summer Game Fest. However, the game will retain the elements that defined the first game such as having to shine enemies with the flashlight in order to purge the darkness for a short period of time and exposing them to gunfire. While Remedy Entertainment still hasn't revealed too much regarding the combat, this new comment gives fans a lot of perspective about where the game will go from here."

This absolutely massive discount is thanks to the ongoing Steam Summer Sale, an annual tradition that seems Valve's digital distribution platform offer some jaw-dropping discounts on big games.",
          "This year's Steam Summer Sale is running from June 29 to July 13, so <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/steam/'><em>Steam</em></a> users have a couple of weeks to take advantage of the savings. Big games like the <em>Dead Space</em> remake, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> are all enjoying healthy discounts, while users can also get the Steam Deck at a lower price as well. However, arguably the best deal out of the bunch is the Valve Complete Pack, which has had its price knocked down by 96% while the Steam Summer Sale is live.",
          "The Valve Complete Pack, available for just $6.54 for a limited time, comes with 22 games, some of which are considered to be some of the best video games of all time. This includes both <em>Half-Life</em> games, both <em>Left 4 Dead</em> games, and both <em>Portal</em> games. The Valve Complete Pack is genuinely one of the best deals in gaming even when it's at full price, so being able to get all these titles and more for $6.54 is an absolute steal. Again, those interested have until July 13 at 10am PT to jump on the opportunity to buy the Valve Complete Pack at a 96% discount.",
          "Those that are diligent about taking advantage of the best Steam deals very likely already have these games, and in fact, they may have acquired them through the Valve Complete Pack. As some may recall, the Valve Complete Pack enjoyed an identical discount a few months back during the Steam Spring Sale. Offering so many games at such a low price is a good way to draw in customers who may then see some of the other deals on offer and be tempted to pick up some other titles while they're grabbing the Valve Complete Pack.",
          "Of course, it's worth pointing out that the Valve Complete Pack isn't really 'complete' anymore. Valve has since released new games that are currently not part of the bundle, with the most notable being acclaimed VR game <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>. It will be interesting to see if Valve ever updates the Valve Complete Pack offerings, but even if it doesn't, it's still easily one of the best deals in all of gaming."

The open world Soulslike's popularity has persisted since then, but if its resurgence to the top of Steam's best-sellers list is any indication, it seems there are still many who have yet to give <em>Elden Ring</em> a shot.",
          "<em>Elden Ring</em> has been credited with breaking down the boundaries that have kept many gamers from enjoying FromSoftware's Soulslikes. <em>Elden Ring</em>'s open world format has lent itself well to FromSoftware's formula, giving those who would normally be turned off by the roadblocks players often bump into in those games the chance to simply explore in a different direction and keep playing in situations that would have normally seen them give up.",
          "Now <em>Elden Ring</em> has found itself back at the very top of Steam's top sellers after the Steam Summer Sale went live and gave the game a nice 30% discount, allowing newcomers to pick it up for just $41.99 instead of the usual $59.99 asking price. With <em>Elden Ring</em> winning Game of the Year at the 2022 Game Awards and standing as one of the best-selling games of all time, it's really no surprise that many Steam users are jumping at the opportunity to add it to their digital libraries. Since the Steam Summer Sale lasts until July 13, it will be interesting to see if it's able to climb back to the very top.",
          "The rest of the top 10 is quite interesting. Right now, the best-seller is the Steam Deck, Valve's handheld gaming device. The $399.00 version of the Steam Deck is currently discounted by 10% as part of the Steam Summer Sale. It's relatively rare for gaming consoles to get price discounts, so anyone that wants to get a Steam Deck at a slightly lower price than usual should take advantage of this deal while they can.",
          "Following the Steam Deck are <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> (which is a free-to-play game, so it has an unfair advantage, to say the least), <em>BattleBit Remastered</em>, <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/elden-ring/'><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, the critically-acclaimed Dave the Diver, open world <em>Harry Potter</em> action-RPG <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, early access game <em>Six Days in Fallujah</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>.

For years, players have been asking for the release of an <em>Overwatch</em> animated series, which did not chang with the release of <em>Overwatch 2</em>. <em>Overwatch 2</em> players continue to wait for a production that tells them more about fan favorite heroes like Mercy and Tracer, or reveals details about major events in <em>Overwatch</em>'s lore. Thankfully, an upcoming project seems to be a step toward that.",

In the first image, players can see the control room screen from launch, while the second shows the same screen after one of the updates <em>Overwatch 2</em> received this year. The player notices that one of the images on the 'active threats' screen got replaced, and this image is one of the scenes in the Genesis announcement trailer.",

In the announcement trailer, <em>Overwatch 2</em> players spotted some scenes from the Omnic Crisis, which would make the miniseries a prequel to the events of <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Another highlight of the trailer is the appearance of Mina Liao, one of the leading robotics experts in the <em>Overwatch</em> universe. Mina Liao is a key figure in the development of Omnics who is best known for having created Echo, the damage hero from <em>Overwatch 2</em>.",
          "While Genesis is not a large-scale project released in cinemas or by a streaming platform, the animated miniseries comes at a crucial time for <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Since its launch, <em>Overwatch 2</em> has experienced constant controversy over constant issues with bugs, balancing, and poor matchmaking. Last month, Blizzard ignited another debate by limiting access to <em>Overwatch 2</em>'s story missions and requiring players to pay for the content. With the release of Genesis, Blizzard is attempting to bring positive attention to <em>Overwatch 2</em> by exploring a still-popular facet of the franchise: the story."

        "article": [
          "A leak from the latest <strong><em>Counter-Strike 2</em></strong> update has revealed a massive rework to Inferno, one of the game's most popular maps. <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> features plenty of huge changes from <em>CS:GO</em>, but a rework of Inferno is a surprise to most.",
          "The reveal of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> earlier this year was a massive surprise. <em>CS:GO</em>'s popularity was creeping up after a few years of stagnation, and shaking the formula up in any way risked disrupting that. It did anything but. <em>CS:GO</em> broke its own Steam player record upon <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s reveal, and proceeded to repeat the feat multiple times in the months after. The <em>Counter-Strike</em> franchise has always been a staple of the FPS genre, but at the moment it seems to have entered a new stratosphere of popularity among casual and hardcore gamers. Hopefully, the release of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> doesn't disappoint, and the numbers continue to grow each day.",
          "The post in question was posted by Reddit iMarbot and can be viewed here, and it includes screenshots of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s version of Inferno. The visual style of the map has received a massive overhaul, but the biggest change comes on the A-site, which is typically seen as one of the hardest to retake in the game. Players can no longer hide behind the graveyard stairs on the A-site, giving players entering the bombsite one less place to check. It's an enormous change that will affect how the map is played, from the lowest levels all the way up to competitive play. As well as this, the area formerly known as 'construction' by players has now become 'church', with Valve using it to show off <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/counter-strike/'><em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>'s fancy new lighting engine.",
          "These screenshots appear to have been data-mined from the latest <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> update, which removed Mirage from the Closed Test map pool and instead added Nuke and Office. At the moment, Valve is slowly releasing maps to players one by one, so it can iron out any major bugs before the game releases in full later this Summer. While the gameplay changes to the map have been well-received, not everyone is a huge fan of the color. In the Reddit thread, many refer to the map's desaturation, especially given that Inferno is one of the most colorful maps in <em>CS:GO</em>. Everything is still in flux at the moment, so Valve could still make bolder color decisions in the final version of Inferno.",
          "Despite consistent updates to the Closed Test, Valve remains coy about when the full game will actually drop. It was given a tentative 'Summer 2023' date when it was first revealed, so in theory, it could drop any day now. <em>CS:GO</em> skin prices have gone wild after <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s reveal, and at this point, it's hard to imagine anything calming it down given the incredible hype for the game."

          "<em>Minecraft</em>'s success inspired a wide variety of games where players can have the same experience of surviving, building, and adventuring. Examples include <em>Stardew Valley</em>, <em>Fallout 4</em>, and even <em>Trove</em>, a charismatic sandbox RPG whose graphics will remind a lot of Mojang's game. <em>Minecraft</em> also got spin-offs like the recent <em>Minecraft Legends</em>, which offer a fun experience inspired by the original game. For <em>Minecraft</em> players, there is a world that captivates people of all ages to bring their ideas to life.",
          "Reddit user octavian_world showed other <em>Minecraft</em> players their impressive world that took nine years to complete.

Other pictures show the city at night and in the rain, which gives it a darker, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>-esque appearance. Additional images shared by the player show a large forest with tall trees, and snowy mountains reminiscent of the iconic snowy area in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>.

In the comments, the player said the images 'showed maybe 4% of their world', making <em>Minecraft</em> players curious about the dimensions of the project. Players have asked octavian_world to put the world up for download, and the player said they are considering downloads, but it is not yet fully confirmed. In the meantime, the player will open public servers starting with a pre-event in November this year, and the launch of the full server for <em>Minecraft</em> players next year.",
          "The <em>Minecraft</em> community always gives very creative uses to the game's resources to make different kinds of projects. Many players like to recreate locations from games in <em>Minecraft</em> or places from anime and movies. The patience of <em>Minecraft</em> players is also enormous for working on original ideas, be they medieval worlds, temples, and even games within <em>Minecraft</em>. These ideas take the 'make your own adventure' philosophy of sandbox games to the next level and help <em>Minecraft</em> stand the test of time."

        "subTitle": "A well-known game studio hits back at PlayStation's claims that developers and publishers dislike Xbox Game Pass for being 'value destructive.'",
        "article": [
          "Sports Interactive Director Miles Jacobson hit back at Sony's recent criticism of <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong>. During Microsoft's federal trial with the FTC over its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, it came to light that PlayStation's Jim Ryan called Xbox Game Pass destructive, positing that 'all' major publishers 'unanimously' dislike the service.",
          "While Microsoft's attorneys questioned Ryan's suggestion that he speaks for the entire industry, the Sony Computer Interactive CEO insisted that this unfavorable perspective of Xbox Game Pass was a commonly held view across the gaming space. This wasn't the first that the executive pushed back against the $68.7 billion deal, as Ryan repeatedly met with regulators over the Activision Blizzard acquisition since Microsoft announced its blockbuster buyout attempt in early 2022.",
          "Ryan's latest criticism of Xbox Game Pass has now been directly disputed by Jacobson, with the Sports Interactive boss asserting that PlayStation doesn't speak for all third-party developers and publishers. Elaborating on that point in a recent interview with Eurogamer, Jacobson said that 'different games work well in different situations', suggesting that generalized statements like Ryan's claim that 'all' publishers dislike Xbox Game Pass have little basis in reality. From Sports Interactive's perspective, the decision to bring <em>Football Manager</em> to Xbox Game Pass yielded extremely positive results, not least because it massively expanded the reach of the studio's flagship series, Jacobson revealed.",
          "Sports Interactive's parent company appears to share that sentiment, as Sega previously went on record to praise Xbox Game Pass, citing it as a major factor driving the continued growth of its numerous franchises. Apart from <em>Football Manager</em>, the Japanese publisher has so far brought many games from the <em>Yakuza</em> and <em>Persona</em> series to Xbox Game Pass. Its partnership with Microsoft has also been deepening in recent times, as underlined by the fact that the recently announced <em>Persona 3</em> Reload and <em>Persona 5</em> Tactica will be day-one Xbox Game Pass releases, which is a first for this long-running JRPG franchise.",
          "Asked about the recent revelation that Microsoft considered buying Sega prior to proposing the Activision Blizzard acquisition, Jacobson said he had no knowledge of that possibility. The Sports Interactive chief explained that he's 'normally' informed about such high-level developments, implying Microsoft never entered any serious acquisition talks with Sega.",
          "Sports Interactive's willingness to support subscription-based game services doesn't end with <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/'><em>Xbox Game Pass</em></a>; back in late 2022, the UK studio decided to launch <em>Football Manager 2023</em> Touch as an Apple Arcade exclusive. Some half a year later, Sony added a time-limited trial of <em>Football Manager 2023</em> to the list of its PS Plus Premium perks."

          "The remaster of the hit dinosaur survival game <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>, <strong><em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em></strong>, which is being built in Unreal Engine 5, has seen a small delay from its original August release date. Originally announced earlier this year, <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/ark-survival-evolved/'><em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em></a> is aiming to bundle all the original game's DLC expansions into one cleaner-looking package ahead of its <em>Ark 2</em> sequel.",
          "Since its 2015 release, <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em> has quickly become one of the most popular titles in the world of survival games with its focus on being able to fight and tame an array of different dinosaurs. Having been first revealed at The Game Awards 2020, the sequel <em>Ark 2</em> is set to feature Hollywood actor Vin Diesel as it carries the survival franchise forward using Epic's newly developed Unreal Engine 5. With some of the very first Unreal 5 games like <em>Lords of the Fallen</em> and <em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</em> finally beginning to near release dates, <em>Ark</em> fans have been eager to learn more about <em>Ark 2</em> and <em>Survival Ascended</em>. Though, fans will now have to wait a bit longer for the latter.",
          "Developer Studio Wildcard has announced the delay of the <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em> remaster from August to October, with no specific date, as the team works through some challenges with Unreal Engine 5. The DLC expansions from the first game that are set to be included in <em>Survival Ascended</em> will be fragmented and released following the remaster's October launch. The Island DLC will be included in <em>Survival Ascended</em> day one, while Scorched Earth will be made available in December. Additionally, the Ragnarok and Aberration DLC expansions will make their way to the remaster in Q1 2024.",
          "The price of <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em> will see a change as well. Its previous $60 price tag will be lowered to $45 for early access with a $5 discount at launch. Additionally, with <em>Survival Ascended</em> essentially replacing the original <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em> game, a changing of the guard for the servers will need to take place. Now that <em>Survival Ascended</em> has been delayed to August, the <em>Survival Evolved</em> servers will see closure on September 30. The <em>Ark</em> community has been displeased with having to purchase the remaster in order to continue playing. Since this is a live service survival game, making the remaster a free update for existing players would be ideal, especially with <em>Survival Evolved</em> being taken offline permanently, but this isn't the case as of now.",
          "As the wait for <em>Ark 2</em> continues, fans of the dino survival sandbox can look forward to a potentially better looking version of the original game this Fall. As this coming October is loaded with major blockbusters like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, <em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, and more, it'll be interesting to see if <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em> will be able to cultivate and maintain a larger audience of new fans ahead of <em>Ark</em> 2."

        "article": [
          "Square Enix has canceled <strong><em>Just Cause: Mobile</em></strong> and will promptly be removing its beta version from Google Play. The ill-fated project was meant to be the first-ever <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/just-cause/'><em>Just Cause</em></a> spin-off not made by Avalanche Studios Group but one of Square Enix's internal teams. The iOS version of the game will hence never see the light of day.",
          "Square Enix originally announced <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> in late 2020 with an eye for a 2021 release. However, the game ended up suffering multiple delays with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Japanese gaming giant did end up launching an early access version of <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> for Android smartphones and tablets in November 2021, but that release was limited to Singapore. The preview eventually made its way to several more countries in Southeast Asia by mid-2022, but that's as far as it went.",
          "Following multiple <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> delays, the game has now been canceled, VGC reports, citing an official confirmation from Square Enix Global Brand Manager Anne-Lou Grosbois-Favreau. The company representative thanked the fans for their support of the project, adding that game cancellation announcements are 'never easy.' This turn of events might not come as a surprise to anyone who played the early access version of <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em>, as Square Enix already refunded all in-game purchases on February 24, Grosbois-Favreau confirmed.",
          "The version history of <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> is another piece of evidence suggesting that the project wasn't killed overnight, as its still-active Google Play page reveals that the preview version of the game was last updated in mid-December 2022. For clarity, early access titles are typically updated on a regular basis, with monthly or even weekly patches being a fairly typical occurrence for such games. So, while Square Enix had only now officially pulled the plug on this project, it would appear that <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> had been on the ropes since at least last year.",
          "The decision to cancel <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> was possibly partially motivated by its developer-publisher's recent commercial struggles. Back in February, Square Enix reported a worrying decline in sales across the board, which prompted the company to announce a number of resource consolidation efforts, including its decision to absorb Forspoken developer Luminous Productions in May.",
          "The cancellation of <em>Just Cause: Mobile</em> won't necessarily have any bearing on the future of the franchise itself. Back in mid-2022, Square Enix already hinted at Just Cause 5 being in development, having assured investors that this long-running series wasn't part of its $300 million deal with Embracer Group that recently saw it sell some of its Western studios and IPs to the Swedish holding company."

        "article": [
          "It seems Ubisoft Montreal is adding a new interesting feature into <strong><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em></strong> that will give players more information about the time period and setting of the upcoming video game. With many of the <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> gameplay features mostly centering around the series' main theme of espionage, it is not surprising for the devs to bring back another one that will help educate the player base.",
          "Since the official announcement of <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> in 2022, Ubisoft has slowly been revealing more information about the upcoming game. Fans now have more details about its story, setting, and the gameplay, allowing them a sneak peek of what to expect once the title fully launches in 2023. Now that traversal and battle features have been made clear, it seems Ubisoft wants to make players more excited about all the other bells and whistles, especially the educational aspect of <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>.",
          "In a recent news post on the Ubisoft website, the team shared that a new feature called the 'History of Baghdad' will be included in <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/assassins-creed-mirage/'><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em></a>. Integrated as part of the in-game Codex and database, the feature will provide players with historical context about locations, items, and cultural events that they will encounter while they journey with the main character Basim throughout ninth century Baghdad. Players can unlock this information via their playthrough, and these articles will fall under five different topics such as Economy, Belief & Daily Life, Government, Art & Science, and Court Life.",
          "To make the History of Baghdad as historically accurate as possible, Ubisoft had employed the historian Dr. Raphaël Weyland to work specifically on the development of <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>. Weyland was given the freedom to curate most of the content that would appear in the Codex feature, specifically elements that players could discover in the game. Ubisoft also partnered with different Middle East history experts and international museums with incredible exhibits of Islamic art in order to bring Baghdad to life in the video game.",
          "Though many in the player base are more interested in how <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> will play, there are those who will probably enjoy the game for the historical information it can provide. Given just how dedicated Ubisoft has been in making sure many of their historical settings are accurate and concise, the same can probably be expected with <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>. Until then, fans will have to wait until launch day to find out and see this for themselves."        ],

        "article": [
          "The creative director of <strong><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></strong>, Emile Morel, has passed away at the age of 40, leaving behind a legacy of beloved Ubisoft classics and more. A Ubisoft game designer with a particularly long and storied tenure, Morel worked on <em>Rayman Legends</em>, among numerous other titles, which is often considered to be one of the finest side-scrolling platforming titles of all time.",
          "<a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/beyond-good-and-evil-2/'><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> has had a long and troubled development period, with Morel only taking over the project earlier in 2023. While this meant that he didn't have the opportunity to see the project through before passing, his team members have highlighted that Morel did leave a lasting impression and appears to have been happy with the game's progress.",
          "Ubisoft reiterated earlier this year that <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> is still in development, even though there hadn't been any major news on that front for some time at that point. The unexpected passing of its creative director will surely slow things down for the rest of the dev team. Ubisoft is yet to comment on Morel's death and what it means for the game's continued production.",
          "As one of the biggest contemporary game productions seemingly stuck in development hell, the loss of <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>'s second creative director is a huge deal. It's worth remembering that Morel took over from the game's previous creative director, Jean-Marc Geffroy, earlier in 2023. Geffroy was taken off the project during a restructuring attempt at the studio, and with development still under wraps, it's unclear how much progress the game has made under Morel's guidance.",
          "It's worth pointing out that things seem to have been going better over the past couple of years. <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> devs expected cancellation back in 2021, but the production persevered and may have even hit its stride after Morel took over. Whether such optimism is displaced or not remains to be seen."

Viewers can get a glimpse of Reinhardt defending a group of soldiers from an omnic attack before the video shifts to a documentary 'talking heads' style approach.

        "article": [
          "<strong><em>Monster Hunter</em></strong> Now isn't expected to make money, Capcom has said. This unusual bit of insight into the upcoming title arrives mere weeks after <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> opened a new limited beta test ahead of its full-fledged release.",
          "Originally announced in April, <em>Monster Hunter</em> Now is an AR mobile game from <em>Pokemon GO</em> developer Niantic. Much like the studio's greatest hit to date, its <em>Monster Hunter</em> spin-off promises to combine geolocation-based exploration with action gameplay and resource collection.",
          "And while <em>Pokemon GO</em> isn't as popular as it used to be, the game still made billions of dollars over the past seven years, making Capcom's investors excited about the prospects of <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>. Yet the Japanese company insists that its primary motivation for licensing <em>Monster Hunter</em> to Niantic has nothing to do with the immediate money-making potential of such a move, having said as much during its latest general shareholder meeting. Asked about Capcom's expectations for <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, a company official revealed that the publisher primarily anticipates the game to boost the series' global brand instead of generate 'revenue contributions.'",
          "Capcom is not the first Japan-based gaming giant to adopt such a publicity-driven approach to mobile games. Back in December 2022, Nintendo also said its mobile games weren't meant to make money, with one of its officials claiming that titles like <em>Super Mario Run</em> and <em>Mario Kart</em> Tour were primarily developed as marketing tools. Yet that particular sentiment was expressed in defense of Nintendo's declining mobile profits, whereas Capcom seemingly adopted a similar perspective in order to preemptively downplay the commercial expectations for <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>.",
          "For clarity, Capcom is no stranger to mobile development, but most of its past efforts in this space were focused on ports of classic titles such as <em>Mega Man X</em> and the Ace Attorney games. Its latest <em>Monster Hunter</em> mobile game also followed that trend, having materialized in the form of the 2018 port of <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, formerly a 3DS exclusive. In contrast, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is Capcom's first contemporary attempt at putting out a mobile-only spin-off based on one of its massively popular franchises. So, irrespective of any commercial expectations attached to the project, the circumstances that led to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> still seem more akin to those surrounding <em>Pokemon GO</em> or even <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> than <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>.",
          "As for Capcom's other near-future plans, its latest shareholder meeting yielded a confirmation that the publisher isn't ruling out the possibility of remaking non-numbered <em>Resident Evil</em> games. A company representative also revealed that Capcom is currently looking into the possibility of reviving the Onimusha series."

One of the biggest Mythic Keystone complaints about Season 2 of <em>Dragonflight</em> has been the increased difficulty that healers have been dealing with, as the amount of total dungeon runs sunk well below expected numbers. Furthermore, the nerfs to off-spec hybrid healing that were planned for Patch 10.1.5 would have further introduced hardship for Mythic Keystone teams, despite tanks and damage dealers otherwise enjoying a smooth experience.",

          "While the new <em>World of Warcraft</em> megadungeon will only become part of the Mythic Keystone rotation in Season 3, it will nevertheless be a great source of loot for players seeking to bridge the item level gap and replace their weakest equipment. Though players were hoping Dawn of the Infinite would be more of a progression experience, many fans were under the impression that the initial buffs made the megadungeon overtuned. The nerfs seem to specifically be targeting Chrono Lord Deios and the Blight of Galakrond bosses, practically halving the damage Galakrond can make with abilities such as Necrofrost, Corrosion, and Necrotic Winds.",
          "The changes were spotted and documented by Wowhead, and given that Fractures in Time is releasing on July 11, this may well be the final iteration of the upcoming megadungeon prior to launch. In addition to the latest changes, Dawn of the Infinite was previously hit by nerfs to Chronikar, Deios, and the Manifested Timeways, reducing the amount of healing required to endure the encounters. Though this fails to address the underlying issues that currently plague healers in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, it should make the initial version of the megadungeon a lot easier to stomach.",
          "Many community voices, whether popular streamers or casual players, have pointed towards Mythic Keystone healers in particular suffering from the nerfs, as spot healing continues to be in a bad spot ever since Embers of Neltharion launched. Though some <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/'><em>World of Warcraft</em></a> players have argued the difficulty of Mythic Keystones is at a good spot right now, it arguably comes at a great burden to healers, as opposed to spreading out the responsibility to tanks and damage dealers alike. Ultimately, many fans are hoping that the nerfs to Dawn of the Infinite will extend to Mythic Keystones proper, even if they have to wait till Season 3 to see it."

        "article": [
          "As per the latest Developer Insight by Bungie, several <strong><em>Destiny 2</em></strong> Exotic weapons and archetypes are set to receive significant buffs in the upcoming mid-season balance patch. Usually, major updates to weapon functionality and archetypes are reserved for the annual expansions or the beginning of a season. For a while, however, Bungie has begun rolling out a mid-season patch for <em>Destiny 2</em>, addressing any game-breaking bugs and glitches, underperforming weapons and Exotics, and much more to benefit player experience.",
          "Part of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s prolonged success as a looter shooter title can be attributed to the game's incredible combat system, seamlessly mixing gunplay and ability-based gameplay. From projectile weapons to energy cannons and bladed swords, <em>Destiny 2</em>'s massive arsenal offers players a ludicrous amount of choice when picking a favorite weapon. Exotic weapons hold a special place in <em>Destiny 2</em>'s combat landscape, coming equipped with special perks that are either perpetually active or triggered by completing specific actions, granting the weapon increased lethality, functionality, and synergy with other mechanics. While these weapons are quite capable on their own, the true potential is only realized when incorporated by players into thematic builds.",
          "Graviton Lance is one such Exotic Pulse Rifle that has remained relatively unchanged since the launch of <a><em>Destiny 2</em></a>, save for receiving a facelift with the Void 3.0 verbs added to its capabilities. In the latest Developer Insight, Bungie has stated that Graviton Lance will receive an additional 67% buff against PvE targets to balance its lethality compared to other Exotic Pulse Rifles. It's not all buffs, however, as the damage from the Cosmology explosions has been decreased by 40% in PvP only, as well as removing the aim assist from the catalyst. As for other Exotics, the No Time To Explain Pulse Rifle has received a nerf to its effective range, and Fighting Lion's Exotic perk has been restored to its full functionality.",
          "The mid-season patch has several changes in store for many weapon archetypes to compensate for the ever-changing meta of <em>Destiny 2</em>. Pulse Rifles, especially the High-Impact subfamily, will receive a boost in their auto-aim angle at lower aim assist ranges. The effective range for Lightweight Bows has been increased at all tiers, alongside a buff to final accuracy by nearly 10%. The dynamic reticle for Submachine Guns has been reworked to offer players more visual clarity during combat. Finally, Lightweight Shotguns will have tighter pellet spread in longer ranges, increasing the lethality in PvP. Post-patch, the Gutshot Straight and Slickdraw perks will have reduced auto-aim penalty, while the infamous Target Lock perk will only offer a 25% damage boost in PvP instead of the current 40%.",
          "These upcoming changes reflect the changes coming to Destiny 2's weapons, but the developers have promised that changes to other aspects are in the works for the mid-season patch. The Developer Insight states that these changes will help Bungie bring more significant changes to <em>Destiny 2</em> in the future."

          "<em>Spider-Man 2</em> is the third titles in Insomniac’s series about the web-slinger’s adventures, after <em>Spider-Man</em> and <a href='https://gamerant.com/spider-man-miles-morales-mod-punk-skin-across-spiderverse/'><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em></a>. This is also one of PlayStation’s first PlayStation 5 exclusive titles, which indicates that Sony could be gearing up to bid adieu to the PlayStation 4. Fans weren't really happy with the length of Miles Morales, but hopefully that won't be the case with <em>Spider-Man 2</em>.",
          "As reported by Twisted Voxel, the pre-load details for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/spider-man-2/'><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em></a> have been revealed via a pre-ordered digital copy of the game which says that the expected auto-download date for the digital version is October 13, 2023. Additionally, the pre-load will also include an update that will be required to run the game on launch day, which players with the disc version will have to install at launch. Furthermore, there could also be an additional Day 1 patch, which could be an additional update for players to install.",
          "The file size for <em>Spider-Man 2</em> isn’t available yet but players are hoping for it to be under 100 GB as the physical version of the game only comes with one disc. However, considering the game is purely made for the PS5, this might not be the case as the visual and gameplay upgrades might take up more space. Additionally, the map size of <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is reportedly twice that of its predecessor, which further reinforces the idea of it being over 100 GB in size.",
          "Of all the new features coming to the game, the character switching in <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> seems to be the most exciting. Game director Bryan Intihar revealed that while there are specific story and side missions for both Miles and Peter, players will be able to manually switch between the two during world exploration as well. Additionally, this will also tie into the 3 skill trees in the game, where there will be two individual skill trees and a shared one as well. The game also features Peter Parker in the Symbiote suit, which might also get its own upgrades until the symbiote moves on to its Venom host, which players believe is going to be Harry Osborn."

        "article": [
          "<strong><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></strong>'s sales have dropped dramatically in Japan after just one week on sale. Square Enix's highly-anticipated action-RPG has released to a great deal of critical acclaim and while it's broken a PS5 sales record, the game's sales are lagging significantly in its home region.",
          "In its first week on sale, <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/final-fantasy-16/'><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></a> sold about 336,000 physical copies in Japan. This was enough for the game to become the fastest-selling PS5 game in the region, but it was still significantly short of other entries in the franchise. For comparison, <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> posted 702,853 units sold in Japan in its first week on sale, while <em>Final Fantasy 15</em> managed 716,649 units sold.",
          "Not only did <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> debut several hundred thousand units behind its predecessors, but the game has experienced a dramatic drop in just one week. According to Famitsu, <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> only sold 37,763 physical copies in Japan for its second week on sale, a staggering 90% drop. It was even knocked off the top-seller spot by new Switch game <em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em>. Needless to say, this is not a great look for <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, but it may not all be doom and gloom.",
          "One thing working against <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> is its PS5 exclusivity. <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> and <em>Final Fantasy 15</em> released on PS4, which meant that they had a much larger audience to work with than <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> has. It should also be pointed out that these are just physical sales numbers. Digital game sales increase every year, and so it's quite likely that many more gamers in Japan have decided to purchase <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> digitally instead of physically compared to <em>FF7</em> Remake and <em>FF15</em>. It's also worth pointing out that <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> and <em>Final Fantasy 15</em> experienced similar second week drops percentage-wise, though they both still sold significantly more copies in their second week than <em>FF16</em> did.",
          "Even taking these factors into account, though, a 90% drop can still be rather alarming. Square Enix has had some huge financial flops recently, and so it's safe to say that the publishing giant doesn't want to see such a big drop. As more consumers get their hands on PS5 consoles, perhaps <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> will get a sales boost in the region, and the eventual PC port of the game could do wonders as well.",
          "<em>Final Fantasy 16</em> has been critically-acclaimed and has made the short-list for Game of the Year for many gamers, but that's not necessarily translating to the kind of sales that Square Enix would like to see. It's possible that the game is performing much better in other regions or that its digital sales are simply far outpacing its physical sales, which could mean this drop isn't nearly as big of a deal as it seems to be on paper. Until Square Enix provides more information on <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>'s overall sales numbers, all fans can do is speculate about how the game is performing on a global scale."

It is connected to the console via a series of parts, including the strap (object 100) and a different device that can change angles, which should make it compatible with a variety of game room setups. Given how flexible Nintendo made the Switch's design for the sake of adapting to multiple playstayles, such a feature would be right up its alley.",
          "If this patent turns out to be an actual part of the Switch successor and not just a draft, then it would mark Nintendo's second overall foray into smartphone connectivity with its consoles. The original Nintendo Switch comes with a mobile app that allows for online voice chat, friend requests even while away from the console, matchmaking, play appointments, and even intuitive parental controls for younger players. It remains to be seen what exactly this Switch 2 peripheral might entail if it ends up being real, but knowing Nintendo's track record with hardware gimmicks, it should certainly be interesting."

        "article": [
          "<strong>Apple</strong> plans to petition for its Epic Games case to be heard in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. The move will mark its second appellate request in the proceedings, as Apple already appealed the first-instance verdict in the Epic Games case in late 2021.",
          "The ongoing legal clash started in 2020, when Epic implemented changes into Fortnite in an effort to bypass Apple's payment processing mechanisms and avoid paying a 30% cut from the game's microtransactions to the iPhone maker. Apple then pulled <em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store, which prompted Epic to launch an antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant. And while Apple's countersuit filed in response to that move was soon dismissed, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled in its favor on nine out of ten counts in the original case. However, the court also ruled that Apple must allow third-party purchase options in apps as part of the same verdict.",
          "After the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld that decision in the Epic Games v. Apple case this past April, the iPhone maker is now looking to petition the Supreme Court to reconsider the second-instance verdict. In a July 3 court filing obtained by Reuters, Apple argued that the appeals court's decision to issue a nationwide injunction against Apple due to its alleged violations of California's Unfair Competition Law constitutes judicial overreach. For context, the said ruling stems from the court's finding that Apple's anti-steering policies preventing developers from directing or even so much as informing its users about third-party iOS storefronts were anticompetitive.",
          "Although Apple intends to continue fighting the actual contents of that decision, it has now requested a stay of the court's mandate on the basis that a nationwide injunction against its anti-steering practices is a disproportional reaction to its alleged violations of California's antitrust law. The tech giant's attorneys also argued that the original lawsuit only had a single plaintiff, Epic, concluding that the court's mandate to stop Apple from enforcing its anti-steering policies against all developers of iOS apps available in the U.S. is hence an overreaction.",
          "While <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/apple/'>Apple</a> is arguing that its petition to the Supreme Court has a decent chance of being heard due to the 'substantial questions of law' it raises, it remains to be seen whether the ultimate appellate authority in the U.S. agrees with that sentiment.

          "Players who want to be surprised by <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> may want to be wary over the next few months, as some major story spoilers might be lurking around the internet already. <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> marks a new chapter in the long-running <em>MK</em> saga, with Fire God Liu Kang resetting the timeline following the events of <em>Mortal Kombat 11</em>’s Aftermath DLC. As a result, Earthrelam is enjoying an untold era of warmth and peace, at least until the evil Shang Tsung returns from oblivion to threaten existence once more.",
          "<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s rebooted timeline has also altered the lives of various members of <em>MK</em>’s hefty roster of playable combatants, as noted in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s newly updated character bios. While Scorpion and Sub-Zero were once the most hated of rivals, in Liu Kang’s new world they are instead brothers and comrades. Likewise, former enemies Kitana and Mileena now co-exist, but Mileena is suffering from a deadly illness that could bring them to conflict once again. Indeed, <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s plot could take these characters on a path similar to their past selves or in a new direction altogether, which makes the wait for the game all the more gripping.",
          "As the gaming world waits for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/mortal-kombat-1/'><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></a>’s release this September, an old Reddit post full of potential spoilers has now returned to the surface. Posted two years ago, this massive leak contains several major plot details for <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, along with a few surprisingly accurate predictions about the upcoming sequel’s gameplay and character dynamics, in the form of cryptic visual clues. Other users like Grandpaseth85 have since solved these riddles, and as more official details about <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> continue to emerge some are starting to wonder if the leak is more legit than initially believed.",
          "In addition to Scorpion and Sub-Zero now being brothers and the existence of a mysterious 'Tarkat Plague', the now-deleted Reddit leak managed to foretell <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s new Kameo mechanic, which allows players to select a secondary supporting fighter that can be called upon to perform punishing combos during matches. Most of the potential spoilers hidden in the post remain mere speculation, but it's hard to deny that it managed to correctly predict a fair amount of plot and gameplay details for <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>.",
          "This is no guarantee that the <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> Reddit leak is completely accurate, but fans who don’t want to have <em>MK 1</em>’s rebooted plot potentially ruined might want to keep away from certain parts of the internet until <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> releases this fall in case these tidbits are indeed actual spoilers. In the meantime, NetherRelam will likely unveil more information during the Kombat Kast livestream set for later this week."

          "<em>Dead by Daylight</em> was first released in 2016, but because Behaviour Interactive regularly evolves upon the game's foundations, it has reached the top 20 most-played games on Steam. Many popular Twitch streamers like Otzdarva, Matthew Santoro, and Ohmwrecker also keep Dead by Daylight near the top-viewed games on the platform. As each <em>Dead by Daylight</em> update tends to draw in lapsed players, the contents of the big summer patch will likely bring some fans back to the game.",
          "Teasing that the aforementioned summer update is releasing with the next big <em>Dead by Daylight</em> event, Behaviour Interactive has confirmed some changes to <em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s Onryo, Executioner, Spirit, and Hag. The Onryo will receive the most attention in the summer update like the Projection ability, cursed tapes, demanifestation, and debuffs to the highest and buffs to the lowest tier add-ons. The Projection ability has an added 15-second cooldown to offset the Condemned effect which sees its own alterations, with cursed tapes seemingly playing more of a role after the patch goes live.",
          "The Executioner will see an improvement to its built-in mechanic preventing it from standing too close to cages with survivors in them, while The Hag and Spirit in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> are only seeing adjustments to add-ons like the Mint Rag and Dried Cherry Blossom respectively. Killers and survivors will both be helped or hurt by adjustments to perks like Claustrophobia, Trail of Torment, and Prove Thyself which may cause some players to switch which ones they prioritize. As promised by the Dead by Daylight Anniversary broadcast, Behaviour Interactive is beginning its revisiting of old maps with Coldwind Farm, which is being modernized to be more comparable to newer maps like Toba Landing.",
          "Although Behaviour Interactive has stated that these changes are part of the upcoming summer update, it remains unclear when the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> patch will drop. Given that many of the tweaks are inspired by fan feedback, there may be even more requests that Behaviour Interactive implements in future <em>Dead by Daylight</em> updates."

Additionally, fans will come across a variety of dangerous locations, as players can die due to a particular level’s environmental conditions. Lake of Rot is one such area in <em>Elden Ring</em>, and it may remind some users of the swamps in the <em>Dark Souls</em> games. Now, one fan has shared a neat tactic that can allow gamers to survive in this treacherous location.",
          "A Reddit user named Flint_Vorselon has uploaded a video with this strategy, showing how players can survive the Lake of Rot in <em>Elden Ring</em> for an extended duration. The user first equips <em>Elden Ring</em> talismans that increase immunity before changing their gear to improve this stat even further. After they are done changing equipment, the player traverses the Lake of Rot as a meter showing the status of Scarlet Rot starts to build up. The player starts gradually losing HP after getting inflicted with Scarlet Rot, but the increased immunity and a ridiculous health bar allow them to last longer in this condition.",
          "In one of the comments, Flint_Vorselon has described the strategy in great detail, complete with the list of items and equipment players will require. They mention that they are currently at max level in <em>Elden Ring</em>, with 2,100 health and 230 immunity. The user then shares all the items that increase immunity, with 975 being the total required for this tactic. Additionally, their final health sits at 3,243, which ultimately allows them to survive in the Lake of Rot for around 49 seconds.",
          "Many users in the comments section discuss the effects of Scarlet Rot and how it works in <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/elden-ring/'><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, as gamers talk about how its damage output is calculated. One fan shares another helpful tactic for surviving in this area, as they claim that rolling in Scarlet Rot builds it up at a slower rate, while also reducing the damage output of this status effect. Some users also comment on the ridiculous health bar showcased in the video, with a few players taking this opportunity to share their dislike for the Lake of Rot."

There have been plenty of interesting video game crossovers over the years, but this unintentional one is particularly bizarre.",
          "<em>Elden Ring</em> has been a crazy success for FromSoftware, with the game garnering plenty of critical acclaim upon its release early last year. It was the first title to really introduce the studio's famous SoulsLike formula to the mainstream, an impressive achievement given its focus on high difficulty. <em>Elden Ring</em> was recently back at the peak of sales charts, showcasing just how strong its reputation is in the eyes of the gaming community.",

There's no denying that there are some serious <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> vibes happening here, but it's not clear what the actual cause of this bug is. One user in the thread had a theory that certainly seems plausible. Apparently, <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/elden-ring/'><em>Elden Ring</em></a> has a PC issue where RTX files are corrupted easily, resulting in problems like this. It also means that verifying the integrity of the game's files would solve the problem instantly, so they can at least easily solve their neon Erdtree problem if they want.",
          "Despite <em>Elden Ring</em>'s massive critical acclaim, there's no doubt that gamers have found plenty of interesting bugs in the game. One terrifying <em>Elden Ring</em> bug turned Godfrey into a <em>Silent Hill</em> nurse, which is quite a sight. In a game as large as <em>Elden Ring</em>, it's inevitable that a few glitches slip through the cracks. Luckily, the game has reached a point where anything truly game-breaking has been patched out, which is especially important given the overall length of the game. There's nothing more frustrating than getting hours into a game, only for it to break beyond repair, but with <em>Elden Ring</em>, it's mainly strange visual bugs that remain.",
          "<em>Elden Ring</em> fans remain patient for news about the upcoming <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC. Initially revealed in February 2023, developer FromSoftware has since remained silent on the expansion. It seems that the studio has decided to take its time with the DLC, which is sure to be the right decision. It would have been easy for FromSoftware to swiftly capitalize on the game's success and put out something half-baked that disappointed the community. It would definitely be out of character for the studio, though, which tends to put a ton of care and polish into each release. Hopefully, it isn't too much longer until FromSoftware is ready to discuss more about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>."

Three characters from <em>The Boys</em>, Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir, will be added to <em>Call of Duty</em> by way of limited time operator bundles. Each bundle will also contain three weapon blueprints as well as weapon charms, loading screens, emblems, and more, and will be available to purchase for 2,400 COD Points. Starlight's bundle will be available first on July 12, with Homelander and Black Noir following suit on July 16 and July 20, respectively.",
          "This crossover between <em>The Boys</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> isn't just a cosmetic one, as Season 4 Reloaded will add a limited time field upgrade that players can find and use in <em>Warzone</em> and DMZ. Named Temp-V after the super serum in the show, this new field upgrade will randomly give the user one of four superpowers upon use. Charge Jump launches players across the map, damaging anything near the player's landing spot, while Teleport can dash the player forward, similar to Tracer's iconic Blink ability in <em>Overwatch</em>. In terms of dealing damage, Laser Vision lets players melt their opponents Homelander-style, while Electric Shockwave deals electric damage and can disable vehicles.",
          "The temporary addition of Temp-V to <em>Call of Duty</em> marks the first time a field upgrade is added to the game as part of a crossover event. With Homelander, Starlight, Black Noir, and Temp-V mixing up the action in <em>Warzone</em>, fans of both <em>The Boys</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> are sure to be pleased with what Season 4 Reloaded will bring to the table."

        "article": [
          "As anticipation for the game continues to grow, a <strong><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></strong> developer has revealed that 'you're going to start crying' over the difficulty of the game's Tactician mode. For many, <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> is one of the most exciting upcoming RPGs out there, and this will likely be amazing news for hardcore fans of the genre.",
          "<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> is the latest iteration in the long-running franchise, releasing over two decades after its predecessor. This time around, the game will be developed by Larian Studios rather than BioWare. After the critical and commercial success of the studio's last RPG, <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, the Belgian development studio was seen as the perfect successor to carry the torch and bring <em>Baldur's Gate</em> to modern audiences. The game has already been in Early Access for almost three years with just the first act playable, but it seems the rest of the game will have plenty of exciting content for players to enjoy. It was even reported recently that <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> has 174 hours worth of cutscenes, which is more than enough for most players.",
          "The difficulty news came from Larian Studios' creative director Swen Vincke at the recent Panel From Hell for <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3/'><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>. The panel showed off a ton of new gameplay, as well as a controversial romance scene involving a bear-form Druid that has had the internet divided over the last few days. Vincke went on to describe the game's Tactical mode, the hardest difficulty in <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, claiming, 'you really need to start getting every single advantage that you can, because otherwise you're going to get obliterated... I know you're all badass, I know you're all going to play on Tactician because you can handle it, and then you're going to start crying, and then you're going to say the game is bad. It's not our fault - it's you!'",
          "At the moment, <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> is being described as the closest a video game can get to an authentic <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> experience, so no doubt that news of the game's difficulty will be a hit with RPG fans. It will be fun to see how it lives up to those high expectations, and with just under a month until release, gamers don't have too much longer to wait to find out.",
          "The panel itself brought about a ton of new information about <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> that remained a mystery, even to Early Access players. One of the biggest pieces of news was that <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> will allow players to respec their characters mid-game, which in such a long game will come as a relief to players.",
          "It's interesting to see the hype for <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> swiftly build as the game draws nearer to release. Just a few weeks ago, Larian Studios bumped the release date of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> up a month on PC to avoid the likes of <em>Starfield</em>, a move which has only intensified the general excitement of the community. The wait goes on for Xbox Series X/S players, with no further updates on a release on the platform recently. As per the last update, the developer is currently unable to get the game optimized into a releasable state on the platform, but hopefully it isn't too long before Larian Studios is able to get over that hurdle."

          "Even five years after its release, there's always something new that experienced players can discover about <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. While the detail that Rockstar put into the game was immediately obvious back in 2018, it's only years later that the community has really discovered the true extent of it. It would be easy to assume that everything about the game has been found at this point, yet it never seems to end. Just recently, one <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> player discovered a mind-blowing fishing detail, so even the game's core features are still revealing new details to gamers to this day.",
          "Redditor ghost_toe posted the eerie video online, which shows their character on horseback in the Wild West. They stop as they see a figure atop a hill in the distance, and zoom in with their binoculars. The figure simply waves at the player before riding away, suggesting they'd been watching all along. There have been plenty of weird <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> videos released by the community over the years, but this latest clip by ghost_toe is surely one of the strangest.",
          "Gamers in the thread had plenty of theories about the mysterious figure. Some claimed this was actually <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>'s antagonist Micah Bell, with others claiming to have seen him out and about on their travels across the American West. While not everyone in the thread had clues about their identity, others who had seen them before mentioned that the character was spotted following them for quite a while, so it doesn't seem to be a coincidence. One thing seems to be consistent across all versions of the story - when the player spots this character, they always turn around and leave, which only opens up more questions about their intentions.",
          "With no conclusive evidence regarding the eerie stranger, for now, this will just have to remain one of the Red Dead Redemption series' unsolved mysteries. Hopefully, when it finally releases, <em>Red Dead Redemption 3</em> has a similar amount of strange occurrences that keep people talking years after its release. Right now though, it seems that it could be several years until that title comes to fruition, so at the moment anything a sequel might contain will have to remain up for debate."

          "Every one of <strong><em>Minecraft</em></strong>'s procedurally-generated worlds give players a different experience when starting a new game, but one incredibly fortunate fan makes an amazing discovery when mining beneath their starting base that essentially allows them to skip a big part of the game. With every world in <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/minecraft/'><em>Minecraft</em></a> generated from a unique seed, the potential for adventure and discovery within the game is practically endless.",
          "World seeds in <em>Minecraft</em> dictate everything in terms of a world's generation, including biome placements, cave network generation, and even structure spawns. This means that every new world in <em>Minecraft</em> offers a completely new and fresh adventure, though not every world has to be born from a new seed. World seeds both new and old can be shared by players, which allows multiple people to have their own adventures in what is essentially the same world - even if those gamers are in singleplayer mode. Entering an existing world seed also allows players to find their ideal world to play and build in, as countless awesome <em>Minecraft</em> seeds can be found online.",
          "Starting out can always be either a simple or incredibly challenging task, as <em>Minecraft</em> can spawn players in a resource-rich jungle just as easily as it can spawn them on a barren island in the middle of nowhere. One player though, a fan known as Nicalay2 on Reddit, hits the jackpot after they discover a massive structure right beneath the small base they create at the beginning of their game. The video attached to the post on Reddit shows the player's narrow tunnel leading down from their base and into a stronghold, giving them access to a loot-rich, endgame area right at the start of their adventure.",
          "Strongholds in <em>Minecraft</em> are just one of many unique, pre-generated structures that populate every world in the sandbox game. That said, strongholds are particularly important sites to visit, as they're the only places where players can find portals capable of taking them to <em>Minecraft</em>'s End dimension, and thus the end of the game itself. These places are always found deep underground, and while finding them usually requires the crafting and use of Eyes of Ender, lucky players can simply come across them during regular mining expeditions too.",
          "Naturally-occurring structures in <em>Minecraft</em> seem to have become far more popular in recent years, as updates often use them as a way of implementing new and expansive areas for players to discover. The trail ruins added in <em>Minecraft</em>'s latest Trails and Tales update are just another example of such a structure, though perhaps the most significant structures added to the game in recent history are the Ancient Cities, which saw the introduction of the terrifying Warden mob and multiple new blocks."

        "subTitle": "The main source of frustration in Diablo 4 lies in its itemization, as players gather to outline the biggest issues with Unique and Legendary items.",
        "article": [
          "It's been a month since launch, and players continue to be frustrated over the itemization system present in <strong><em>Diablo 4</em></strong>. In the absence of viable sets, exciting loot, a rewarding endgame, and quality-of-life features, many fans have become nostalgic over <em>Diablo 3</em> and its Greater Rifts. Whereas <em>Diablo 4</em> seems to put greater emphasis on assembling a character's gear, the gameplay in <em>Diablo 3</em> was more concerned with challenging players through increasingly more difficult Greater Rift levels. Obtaining an item set was a trifling matter in <em>Reaper of Souls</em>, but knowing how to make the most of it and how to push beyond one's limit was the bread-and-butter of <em>Diablo 3</em>'s endgame.",
          "Though shifting the focus of the grind toward loot as opposed to content isn't necessarily a bad thing, the key problem that <em>Diablo 4</em> players have with its endgame is that the loot they're meant to chase is either uninteresting from a design standpoint, or nearly mathematically unobtainable. Uber Uniques in <em>Diablo 4</em> have a drop rate unheard of in the genre, even by Path of Exile standards, and when their drop rate accidentally becomes viable enough to farm, Blizzard is quick to patch it out.",
          "However, the frustration in the community runs deeper than just Uber Uniques, as a <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/diablo-4/'><em>Diablo 4</em></a> player by the name of NickBucketTV pointed out that the vast majority of Rogue Legendaries and Uniques don't feel satisfying at all. Given the current lack of balance, both in terms of class and attributes, Bows are automatically useless to Rogues due to the way Damage to Distant Enemies compares against Vulnerable Damage. Affixes and Legendary Aspects suffer from being too situational, and some players are already worried Malignant Hearts follow the same design philosophy.",
          "One of the underlying problems behind this feeling of dissatisfaction lies with the absurd enchanting costs in <em>Diablo 4</em>. It's much easier, and far more viable to turn a Rare item into a 'god roll than it is to salvage a poorly-rolled Legendary. The excitement at endgame in <em>Diablo 4</em> revolves around finding the ideal Rare item with affixes that many consider boring. More often than not, a Legendary item is a disappointment, solely useful for the Aspect it may contain (provided the roll is good), and given that the top-tier Uniques are beyond reach for the vast majority of players, the community's frustration becomes justified.",
          "Ultimately, even though <em>Diablo 4</em> has been widely praised for its campaign, as well as for bringing open world to <em>Diablo</em>, it may take a while until it lives up to its true potential. Though many players are feeling exhausted from the current grind, the live service nature of the game will at least ensure that <em>Diablo 4</em> and its expansions will continue to be supported for many years to come."

          "A <strong><em>Minecraft</em></strong> player online has shared their incredible recreation of every US state's tallest building in-game. In a way, it's similar to the <em>Minecraft</em> group recreating the whole of the UK on a 1:1 scale, despite not quite being on the same level of ambition.",
          "Over the years, the <em>Minecraft</em> community has been one of the greatest in terms of incredible fan creations online. Due to its immense popularity, fans have been active for well over a decade now, recreating anything and everything within the game. It's amazing how no matter what, it seems as though the level of ambition has only increased over time, and it makes sense. With so many fan creations out there, the new ones looking to stand out have to truly be ambitious, or else they risk disappearing into the crowd. One <em>Minecraft</em> player is even recreating <em>Stardew Valley</em>'s world in-game, showing how they don't just have to be based on real-world locations either.",
          "Redditor bubbaflubba2 posted their creation online, showcasing how each of the US state's tallest buildings would look within the sandbox of <em>Minecraft</em>. According to the user, it's completely to scale, making this even more impressive. Interestingly, the title for shortest tallest building goes to Vermont, with an 11-story apartment building standing highest in the entire state. It speaks to the incredible versatility of <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/minecraft/'><em>Minecraft</em></a> that this is a possibility within the game.",
          "The thread itself was filled with gamers wondering exactly where their city stood in the ranking, with the tallest of them all being the One World Trade Center in New York, standing at 1776ft. Illinois was a close runner-up, with Chicago's Willis Tower (1451ft). There have been some huge <em>Minecraft</em> builds shown off in the past, but actually being able to put a number to each of these really puts into perspective how massive these builds really are.",
          "As for <em>Minecraft</em> itself, the game continues to receive an abundance of updates from Mojang to ensure its relevance in the gaming community. <em>Minecraft</em>'s recent Trails & Tales update brought about some of the biggest gameplay innovations the game has seen in a long time, and some gamers are even looking further into the future to see what might come next. Regardless of what any future updates bring, Mojang deserves plenty of credit for continuing to update the game over the last decade when cashing in on a sequel might have been the more financially-prudent move."

        "article": [
          "The <strong><em>Final Fantasy</em></strong> franchise has passed an impressive sales milestone, reaching 180 million units sold. This recent achievement is another reminder of the popularity the <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/final-fantasy/'><em>Final Fantasy</em></a> games have maintained over the years, with many of the installments in the series selling well into the millions of copies, such as the recent release, <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>.",
          "While the success of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> games for Square Enix is no secret, the developer previously revealed back in March 2022 sales data for the franchise, giving a better idea of how massive the series is. Based on this report from the company, the franchise had sold 173 million units. This impressive total was enough to easily make it the most successful of the company’s IPs. However, updated numbers for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> franchise have been revealed, noting that it has passed an impressive sales milestone.",
          "As reported by Push Square, this sales information originated from Kageki Hankyu. This source was unusual as the units sold data was revealed as part of an announcement for an all-female <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> musical theatre production. According to the source, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> franchise had crossed the 180 million units sold threshold. While <em>Final Fantasy</em> has been a success for Square Enix over the past few decades, this latest sales report puts into perspective the enduring popularity of the game series.",
          "It is worth noting a lot has happened in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> franchise between the sales figures revealed in this recent announcement and the ones reported in March 2022. Notably, <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> launched on the PS5 and has sold over 3 million copies. In addition, several remasters of classic games in the series have been released after March 2022. Specifically, <em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion</em>, a remaster of the prequel to <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, and the Nintendo Switch and PS4 versions of <em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em>, a collection of remasters of some of the first games in the series, became available. The sales of these games likely played a part in pushing the franchise past the 180 million unit mark.",
          "It will be interesting to see how this number grows over the coming months. <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> was launched in June, meaning it could sell even more copies on PS5 and potentially come to PC in the months ahead, opening the title up to even more gamers. In addition to the sales of <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, Square Enix has more planned for the franchise. <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> is expected to release in 2024 and is the next game in the <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> remake project. With this in mind, it seems inevitable that the series will cross the 200 million unit mark in the years ahead."

          "<strong><em>Destiny 2</em></strong> players are meticulously thorough regarding details, as one intuitive player notices a recent cosmetic change made to several Combat Bows that correspond to a specific perk. Fashion and character customization are an intricate part of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s identity, with changes even making it into the occasional patch notes. As a result, the larger <em>Destiny 2</em> community has come to expect such small attention to detail alongside the usual grand set pieces and action sequences that the game is known for.",
          "Combat Bows are a newer addition to the <em>Destiny</em> franchise, as the weapon archetype made its debut with the Forsaken expansion. The archetype has remained relatively unchanged in its functionality since then, with balance changes and the overarching damage meta shifting its relevancy throughout the expansions and seasonal launches. Post-Lightfall, Combat Bows have seen a rise in popularity, as the recent weapon rebalancing in <em>Destiny 2's Season of Defiance</em> has turned several Bows into suitable contenders for various roles. Exotic Bows such as Leviathan's Breath and Wish-Ender have created new builds as Legendary Bows have regained some usage in PvP and endgame PvE activities with the inclusion of new perks.",
          "Part of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s charm is its ability to relay data to players via audiovisual cues, whether it's an ability coming off cooldown indicated by a sound bite or increased movement speed outlined by wind trails blowing past a character. Seemingly, the developers have added similar visual functionality to several Combat Bows too, as noticed by a player named SlayForJay. The player has posted their findings on the <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/destiny-2/'><em>Destiny 2</em></a> subreddit, comparing two pictures of a Strident Whistle Legendary Bow with the Harmony and Explosive Head perks. In the first picture, the player has selected the Harmony perk with Strident Whistle possessing a typical arrowhead, whereas, in the second picture, the player switches to the Explosive Head perk changing the arrowhead to a much bulkier one, showcasing the explosive charge.",
          "Several players have mentioned in the comment section that the feature isn't particularly new, as cosmetic ornaments have changed the arrowheads in the past, namely, the 'Aim Is True' ornament for the No Turning Back Legendary Bow showcasing a similar explosive arrowhead. Veteran players have also reminisced how certain Rifles and Handcannons in the past would also change appearances based on the perk selection, with different sights visually representing the stat changes. A similar feature was introduced with the popular <em>Destiny 2</em> Exotic Pulse Rifle Revision Zero receiving additional attachments with each unlocked catalyst, indicating the growing power of the weapon.",
          "Such small changes to the accessibility of existing game systems are always welcome, as players reap passive benefits. With Bungie promising more changes to Bows in future patches for <em>Destiny 2</em>, fans of this elegant weapon will undoubtedly have their eyes peeled for such neat details."

        "subTitle": "A senior member of Tears of the Kingdom’s development team reveals that he has been too busy making the Legend of Zelda game to play Elden Ring.",
        "article": [
          "<strong><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></strong> director Hidemaro Fujibayashi says he was too busy working on the game to play FromSoftware's <em>Elden Ring</em>. The comment came in response to questions about whether <em>Elden Ring</em> might have influenced <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/tears-of-the-kingdom/'><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.",
          "The comparisons between Tears of the Kingdom and <em>Elden Ring</em> might seem odd on the surface, but they don't come out of nowhere. Both games are open-world games and have some similar mechanics. Meanwhile, <em>Elden Ring</em> director Hidetaka Miyazaki cited Breath of the Wild as one of his inspirations, alongside <em>Skyrim</em>, <em>The Witcher 3</em>, and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>. Given that, it wouldn't be too surprising if the inspiration flowed both ways, and Tears of the Kingdom developers borrowed some ideas from <em>Elden Ring</em>.",
          "This question arose during a recent interview with Tears of the Kingdom producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi. However, Fujibayashi denies taking inspiration from <em>Elden Ring</em>, saying he didn't even have time to play the game while developing <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. He went on to say that even if he had played the game, he wouldn't have taken ideas from it. Instead, he says that when Nintendo makes a game, the studio tries to come up with new ideas instead of looking at what other studios are doing.",
          "Responding to a follow-up question from the interviewer, Fujibayashi acknowledged that <em>Zelda</em> games are not always the first to do something. However, he would never deliberately take something from another game. Fujibayashi says he's 'too proud' to do that and always looks for original ideas. That includes not taking too many ideas from earlier The <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games, with Fujibayashi saying any similarities between <em>Ocarina of Time and Tears of the Kingdom</em> are coincidental.",
          "As an example of what he's talking about, Fujibayashi cited a 3D system in 2013's <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em>, where it looked like Link was jumping at the player. This had surprised Nintendo's then-President Satoru Iwata, who told Fujibayashi he didn't know that was possible. 'I was really, really happy to hear that,' said Fujibayashi, 'because to me that's the core of game development: figuring out things that no one else has thought of.'",
          "That isn't to say that <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> was completely free of outside influences. Fujibayashi talked about how he drew from his own life experience rather than from other works. Specifically, he spoke about how being a father influences his work. He wanted the game to have an underlying message, and he says his parenting influenced the screenplay he wrote."

One such law enforcement horse was recently transformed into a burned horse by Reddit user Shot_by_cops.",
          "The Reddit user explained that they shot a law man with incendiary shotgun ammo while playing <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Apparently, the incendiary ammo hit the horse and caught it on fire. The horse somehow survived the incident long enough for the flames to go away. The player then used a horse revive on the creature to bring it back to life, but it retained the damage from its burns. This gave the horse a unique appearance that helped it stand out from the many other horses found throughout <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>'s open world.",
          "Unfortunately for those wanting to get a burned horse of their own, the Reddit user confirmed that it reverted to normal after they fast-traveled. While this is good news for the horse, it's bad news for any <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> players who were wanting to add this kind of horse variant to their collection.",
          "As some may recall, there once was an official Undead Horse variant in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. The Undead Nightmare DLC for the original Red Dead Redemption gave players the chance to ride a zombified horse. Many were holding out hope that Rockstar would create an <em>Undead Nightmare</em>-equivalent DLC for <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, but unfortunately, it never came to pass.",
          "While fans may never get their hands on an <em>Undead Nightmare</em> DLC for <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, it seems fans of the franchise will have something new to look forward to at some point in the near future. Reputable leakers have suggested that a <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> remaster is in development and could release soon. It's unclear if such a remaster would include the <em>Undead Nightmare</em> content or not."

        "subTitle": "The Call of Duty team announces that the Season 4 Reloaded update for Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone will include an expansion to the Vondel map.",
        "article": [
          "It has been announced that the newest update to <strong><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></strong> will introduce a range of new content, including an expansion to the popular Vondel battle royale map. According to a recent post on the official <em>Call of Duty</em> blog, the upcoming Reloaded update for <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> and <a href='https://gamerant.com/tag/call-of-duty-warzone/'><em>Warzone</em></a> will add a sizeable Gulag area beneath the castle on the Vondel map.",
          "<em>Call of Duty: Warzone 2</em> and <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> are both currently in the midst of Season 4, a phase of content development that has been ongoing since June 14. Players have already seen several big additions to <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> during Season 4, and now another major content release, known as the Reloaded update, is set to launch on Wednesday, July 12. The centerpiece of Season 4 Reloaded is a crossover event with acclaimed TV series <em>The Boys</em>, and a variety of new content surrounding that crossover.",
          "Among the announced features of the Reloaded update is a new area to be added to the Vondel map, which will fill the role of a Gulag for this environment. Gulags are a gameplay feature in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, functioning as self-contained arenas where players who have already been killed in a given round can duel each other one on one for a chance to rejoin the match. The new Gulag will take the form of an abandoned wine cellar underneath the castle looming over the map, adding another hidden area in Vondel for players to explore.",
          "Gulags are a fairly unique feature among battle royale games, and are thus often listed as one of <em>Warzone</em>'s main selling points. Given the volatile nature of the gameplay they promote, Gulags have often brought glitches and exploits into <em>Warzone</em> whenever they are expanded or modified in an update. It remains to be seen whether the Vondel Gulag will face any similar issues upon its release.",
          "The Season 4 Reloaded update includes a lot of exciting content that players will likely enjoy, especially those who happen to be fans of The Boys. While the new Gulag is not directly linked to the crossover event at the center of the update, it is certain to shake up future battle royale matches on the Vondel map. There is always the possibility that the new content will cause unforeseen bugs or glitches, similar to the issues with previous <em>Call of Duty</em> updates, but fans will most likely be able to enjoy the update regardless."

Like previous entries in the franchise, much of the game’s appeal for many players lies in the endgame content, with <em>Diablo 4</em>’s Nightmare Dungeons representing some of the title’s biggest challenges.

Remaining gracious in their moment of triumph, AlAlon’s tweet also took the time to thank Blizzard and Diablo community lead Adam Fletcher “for creating this masterpiece.” Cutting things fairly close, the pair achieved the coveted Grandmaster status with less than two weeks to go in <em>Diablo 4</em>’s current season.",

One curious commenter asked if reaching Grandmaster was actually rewarding or just felt the same as farming XP in <em>Diablo 4</em>’s Nightmare Dungeons usually does. Offering a surprisingly subdued response to the question, AlAlon stated that clearing the Nightmare Dungeon was “only about challenge” and not about any potential loot or larger feeling of satisfaction.",

        "article": [
          "Real-time strategy is thriving not only on PC, its natural territory, but also on consoles where in recent years we have been able to enjoy games that were previously unthinkable. The latest addition to this trend is <a href='https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/the-valiant/'><em>The Valiant</em></a>, an interesting RTS set in the Crusades that starts with a genuinely attractive premise, although the game doesn't always shine as brightly as it promised. Nonetheless, it's worth celebrating that we can now lead an army of medieval knights without missing the keyboard and mouse too much, as this adaptation of Kite Games' title perfectly meets the genre's demands without making your life unnecessarily complicated. On the contrary, we're talking about a strategy game that approaches action in such a direct manner that playing with an Xbox or PlayStation controller feels very natural – but that doesn't mean it's perfect. At times, it can be a bit cumbersome to navigate between different squads of soldiers under our command, which is exacerbated by the lack of an option to zoom in and observe the battlefield up close.",
          "<strong><em>The Valiant</em></strong> also doesn't do much to explain how to play or what all those colored bars above the heads of your allies and enemies mean. There are tutorials scattered throughout the early campaign missions, it's true, but they only briefly touch on some of the game's key features, leaving you to read a glossary of terms to understand how things like vengeance or vigor work, for example, aspects that aren't immediately obvious. I want to emphasize that it's not an overly complex game, but if you're not very familiar with strategy games, you might find it difficult to get into the gameplay. It wouldn't have been a bad idea to provide a better tutorial mission so that you can learn everything about this title while playing. <em>The Valiant</em> is an RPG-tinged game that we extensively covered in our original review at the end of last year, so here I will focus on the console adaptation to give you a better idea of whether it's worth making the leap to these new platforms.",
          "I confess that the idea of traveling back in time to fight in the Crusades is incredibly motivating to me, so right from the start, <em>The Valiant</em> is an RTS that has an easy time winning me over. Furthermore, it is very straightforward in combat, with a formula that combines strategy with elements more typical of role-playing games, embodied here by the heroes with unique abilities that can alter the course of the battle. This makes it even easier to have a good time. What's the problem? Sometimes it falls into the trap of being too simple because while the combat works very well on paper, in the medium term, you realize that the formula barely changes from the beginning of the campaign, making some fights even tedious. 'Just end it already!' you say to yourself due to the somewhat slow pace of these skirmishes. It's curious because, as I said, the premise is good.",
          "Archers, heavily armored infantry, spearmen, the always useful cavalry... beyond strategically leading the squads of soldiers under your command, the charm of <em>The Valiant</em> lies in the fact that you have several unique abilities that carry significant weight in the action of this RTS. There are units that can boost the morale of their own and allies, while others can charge fiercely to reach vital strategic positions, simultaneously launching anyone who crosses their path into the air. These actions have a real impact on the battle, so it's not enough to simply say, 'Hey you, go there and fight', because that way you'll lose valuable troops that will likely come in handy during the final stages of the mission. The latter is no small matter, as the game doesn't always gauge the difficulty of the encounter properly, constantly pitting you against hordes of enemies vastly outnumbering you, turning each mission into a battle of attrition... that also wears down your patience. Remember when I mentioned that sometimes the combat becomes tedious? Essentially, the problem is that there aren't enough unique abilities to make each fight feel different from another in a completely distinct scenario. It's always the same. Repeatedly using the same abilities. And that becomes exhausting.",
          "Regarding this console adaptation, the truth is that the controls are good. It's very comfortable and intuitive to activate these special abilities because there's no need to execute complex button combinations, and the interface is visually appealing. Since the game itself focuses on more controlled combat with not too many squads of allies under your control, and base building is limited, there are rare occasions where you can feel overwhelmed by the chaos of battle. And yet, sometimes the screen is filled with enemies to confront. This brings me to discuss the visual aspect of The Valiant, which also holds up well in its transition to PlayStation and Xbox. I played the Xbox Series X version, and overall, both the performance and the level of detail achieved in the environments and troops are adequate. Nothing spectacular, but it doesn't fall short compared to what's seen on PC.",
          "If you're playing it on consoles, in addition to the single-player campaign with 16 missions (each lasting around 30-40 minutes), you can also enjoy the traditional Skirmish mode, online battles, and a Horde mode that challenges you to survive for as long as possible by embodying only the heroes of this medieval story."

          "We have to be grateful for the existence of studios like Dontnod in our industry because these guys never stop experimenting with formulas, avoiding repetition as much as possible. They don't care how many times they may make mistakes because they always get up and try again before giving in to the conventional formulas of our medium. That's something that is scarce in the world of video games, and they once again demonstrate it with <strong><em>Harmony: The Fall of Reverie</em></strong>.",
          "This time, they take us on a journey to discover the story of Polly, a woman who returns to her native island only to find out that her mother has disappeared, while reconnecting with old friends. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, as soon as she arrives, she connects with another plane of existence where she encounters different incarnations of human emotions: Power, Happiness, Bond, Truth, Chaos, and Glory. Polly represents <a href='https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/harmony-the-fall-of-reverie/'><em>Harmony</em></a>, a way to balance all these aspirations, if that's what we desire, or prioritize one over the others.",
          "The truth is, the beginning is not the best. <em>Harmony</em> wants to start off so strongly that it's difficult to maintain interest in these two initially overlapping and explanatory storylines. As we play, we will uncover a story that shows sensitivity and talks about loss, acceptance, and also the modernization of societies, which makes it more interesting. However, in my case, I had the feeling that I never fully empathized or completely immersed myself in it.",
          "In my playthrough, I found myself wondering why this was happening to me. With <em>Harmony: The Fall of Reverie</em>, the studio has ventured into the genre of visual novels to experiment with storytelling in a more direct way, without the need to build an entire exploratory or action experience around it. However, I believe there are some doubts at its core: <em>Harmony</em> is a game that reveals its structure. That is to say, we not only enjoy the visual novel and the decisions we can make within it, but we also 'play' with the path, seeing the nodes and being able to slightly anticipate the consequences by exploring different alternatives before committing to one.",
          "The characters, on the other hand, are completely hand-drawn in two dimensions, with magnificent animations that effectively convey the right emotion in each dialogue line. With just a few frames, they subtly display fragility, insecurity, or surprise in every conversation. The music by Lena Raine, who has already showcased her talent in works like Celeste and Minecraft, once again does an excellent job of reinforcing these sensations and, above all, capturing the spirit of this island which, while somewhat paradise-like, also hides a profound control over its inhabitants.",
          "It is difficult to recommend <em>Harmony: The Fall of Reverie</em> to everyone, as one must first be drawn to its premise, to this ability to change the narrative at will before being able to immerse oneself in its story. However, there is no doubt that it is another work as personal as all those from the studio, which shows their willingness to try everything and continue exploring any possible avenue in video games to tell stories in non-linear ways. And for that audacity, I can only applaud."

          "&quot;This creature is the perfect life form in the galaxy.&quot;With these words, the fantastic and late Ian Holm introduced us to the xenomorph, a creature that has climbed its way to the top of popular culture as one of the most imposing horror monsters. Standing at 3 meters tall, with semi-resistant skin, acid blood, and astonishing agility, it is hailed as the perfect life form in the galaxy. Despite creating a trauma for me when I was only 10 years old watching <em>Alien vs Predator</em> - not even close to the best movie featuring the creature - I hold a great affection for it, and being somewhat masochistic, <strong><em>Aliens: Dark Descent</em></strong> was on my most anticipated list of the year.",
          "The development of a relatively unknown studio like Tindalos Interactive was introduced during the 2022 Summer Game Fest hosted by Mr. Keighley, generating a lot of anticipation. It's not just that they aim to take us back to a setting where the Xenomorph only 'played' in 2003 with <em>Alien vs Predator: Extinction</em>, but they also strive to challenge Alien Isolation for its throne. Many might think that the undisputed best game in the franchise would be out of reach for <em>Dark Descent</em>. However, what if I told you it's a very close call? But let's not jump to conclusions. Whether out of curiosity or genuine excitement for the game, pay attention to the analysis of <a href='https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/aliens-dark-descent/'><em>Aliens: Dark Descent</em></a>.",
          "As soon as we start our first game in <em>Aliens: Dark Descent</em>, which, by the way, offers various difficulty modes and even on the intermediate setting, is a sweat-inducing experience, we encounter the game's first success: Tindalos Interactive's adventure exists completely separate from the film's timeline. In fact, it is entirely detached. Isolation relied on Ellen Ripley's daughter to capture the attention of fans. Dark Descent, on the other hand, decides to set aside any concepts that might overwhelm newcomers and instead positions itself within the same chronological line, after <em>Alien 3</em>, while avoiding any other products of the franchise.",
          "Having overcome the management aspect of the game, it's time to talk about the gameplay itself. If I had to sum it up in a few words, I would say it's a joy to play. The game divides its adventure into days, as I mentioned before. Every 24 hours, you can launch an expedition, in other words, a playable mission. However, this also means that those same soldiers won't be available for the next day. The gameplay is in line with the management aspect, where we won't treat the soldiers as mere polygons but as 'people'. Okay, maybe that's a bit exaggerated, but the game makes an effort to make it clear that all the characters have depth, and what happens in the missions will affect them to a greater or lesser extent. And I'm not talking about minor or short-term things.",
          "Throughout the entire campaign, which will take us approximately 35 hours to complete, we will have several scenarios to explore, each with a certain number of main missions - in addition to other side missions - to complete in order to progress to the next one. They are not very varied in types. Nevertheless, they are maps that I have really enjoyed, emphasizing the word 'really'. They are unexpectedly huge. So much so that if an average mission takes 20 minutes, I can assure you that you will not have explored, at best, even 30% of the entire map before extracting the team. They all have multiple levels, a labyrinthine structure, and many nooks and crannies where the current alien is waiting for its meal.",

If Isolation was the fight of a person against one of these beings, like Alien: The Eighth Passenger; Dark Descent is like James Cameron's Aliens. As good as the original, but bet on different approaches. You may even like one more, but they are outstanding projects. In short, a recommended like few others."

          "When I think of <strong><em>Layers of Fear 2023</em></strong>, one thing comes to mind: James Cameron. Yes, it sounds a bit strange, especially since the Canadian director has never come close to terror in his filmography. But no, all this madness hasn't made me ramble. What he has done is recover his oldest works —authentic jewels where he allowed himself to force the Hollywood machinery— to adapt them to the new times with changes based on the most cutting-edge technologies. The director has taken advantage on several occasions of what he did not have at the time to offer a more polished version of his tapes; just as Bloober Team has done the same with a Layers of Fear that sees how this new installment is the most complete version of the saga of the Poles.",
          "Since its announcement, this <a href='https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/layers-of-fear-2023/'><em>Layers of Fear</em></a> has been thought of as a remake of the first game; a remake of the first two games and the DLC; there has even been talk of a third installment to close the trilogy. It's nothing like that, and at the same time it is. We are talking, remembering Cameron, of a very complete version, to which the rough edges have been smoothed out, of the extravagant work that he put on the studio's radar 6 years ago. A game that connects all the games in very clever ways, adding a dash of meaning to this hodgepodge of psychological horror along the way. And, like the director of <em>Avatar</em>, the move has turned out phenomenally for Bloober Team.",
          "Being such a complex project to follow over time, with <em>Layers of Fear</em> and <em>Layers of Fear 2</em> that seemed to have little to do with each other, The Writer comes into play in this new installment. This one, who opens this new game, will be the link that will unite all the stories while offering a chance to explore many more concepts in this brilliantly built horror universe, and difficult to follow.",
          "In narrative terms, it's a mega-project that surprises me that it doesn't come unstuck and fall apart. The story of this writer, whose name is unknown —although this is a keynote in the saga, we are disturbed minds in a destroyed world— will take us to spend a 'charming weekend in a lighthouse lost by the hand of God'. It is something very similar to the concept of <em>Alan Wake</em>, even that masterful Carpenter's In the <em>Mouth of Fear</em>, where a frustrated writer isolates himself so that solitude can give him peace while writing.",
          "Best of all, without going into any spoilers, is that the new Layers of Fear works on two levels: it is perfect for the newbie, the one who has never played any game in the saga and is interested in this new release; as well as for the most veteran, like me. Best of all, neither of the two player profiles will feel absorbed during the more than 10 hours it lasts. Even those who know it from beginning to end, may feel attracted to see how Bloober herself revisits a saga that is barely 6 years old.",
          "I don't usually bet strictly on one mode or the other, but I think that Layers of Fear is a game that I would recommend enjoying in this second quality option. It is a slow, contemplative action, with a lot of reading and environmental oppression. Ray Tracing in Quality mode fully attacks lighting. The reflections look 'worse' stopped, but it is in the treatment of light and Ambient Occlusion with the shadows colliding between impossible structures, where the real graphic difference with its predecessors is noticeable."

        "subTitle": "One of the most prestigious horror sagas in the video game industry returns with a game that is not afraid to innovate",
        "article": [
          "It's such a harrowing game that for the first few hours, when everything in it is still disturbingly dark, I needed to unplug every few minutes. He would literally quit the game because 'I can't take it anymore'. The funny thing is that just a few moments later there he was again, face to face with that grotesque creature, trapped in a World War I bunker without really knowing where to go. It's nothing new in the <em>Amnesia</em> saga, which has always mastered the art of instilling fear in the body, but this new horror adventure from Frictional Games breaks the trend of its latest episodes, more narratives than survival horror, to directly face one of the most distressing and terrifying experiences of recent times. And that this is the first time you have a weapon to defend yourself from the monster that lurks in the shadows. Well, even so, <strong><em>Amnesia The Bunker</em></strong> is scary.",
          "Death is more present than ever and has greater consequences than what we have seen in the latest games from the studio. If the creature catches you and you haven't saved the game... good bye, try again. But <em>The Bunker</em> is also more than just a 'mouse game' where you just run and hide from the monster. Exploration is more important than ever; You also have many more objects to interact with, and these are such a scarce resource that on more than one occasion you will find yourself deciding between taking one thing or another while a horrifying being roars from the darkness. Everything in this game is designed to give you a hard time, so if it's what you're looking for, if it's what you've been waiting for years, pay attention to the analysis of <a href='https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/amnesia-the-bunker/'><em>Amnesia: The Bunker</em></a> because you're about to enter hell itself.",
          "It has been a recurring criticism in recent Frictional Games games. His stories are incredible; They have moments of those that you don't easily forget because they end up leaving you with a very bad body (that ending of the fascinating Soma...), but when it comes to playing they have gradually lowered the difficulty in favor of a narrative experience without too much interference. <em>The Bunker</em> does just the opposite. It puts you in the middle of a scenario that you can explore freely from the beginning and more than the story, which there is, what matters here is to escape with your life using a wide variety of objects and tools that you find randomly on the scene. You read well.",
          "One of the peculiarities of <em>Amnesia The Bunker</em> is that each game is different from the previous one because although the objective is always the same, to escape using dynamite and a detonator, the key resources you need to achieve it change position. In this sense, the game has a lot of the legendary <em>Resident Evil</em> because over and over again it makes you go from here to there, like in the Spencer Mansion, in search of solutions to problems that you have found in the exact opposite direction. The dynamite is in the arsenal, of course, but to get there first you have to open a hatch using a key that is hidden in a dark corner of the bunker, which you can only access if you have first found a wrench that someone hid in it. your locker, or in your bedroom, or wherever. And now comes the good part, of course. Do all this while escaping from a creepy creature that has a bad habit of appearing at the most inopportune moment.",
          "<em>Amnesia The Bunker</em> is the first game in the series to put a weapon in your hands, but you can get an idea of how effective it is, right? You're barely out of bullets, reloading the revolver is excruciatingly slow, and in the vein of the terrifying <em>Alien Isolation</em>, it only allows you to scare the creature away for a few moments. After the shot, she'll come back angrier than before, which is the last thing you want to see. Frictional Games does this so well that even shooting a padlock to open a door is truly terrifying. It is a deafening explosion; a roar that leaves you stunned for a few moments and almost makes you feel guilty for what you just did. 'It's coming', you tell yourself as you run looking for a hiding place. It is here where you discover another of the great novelties of the game: freedom of action.",
          "It is also true that there comes a point where you lose your fear of the monster, not because it stops being lethal, it always is; but rather, because sometimes it seems that going rough is more effective than walking in the dark keeping all your resources intact. Come on, a good explosion followed by a run in extremis to a safe place is not as bad an idea as it seems. But before reaching that point, it is most likely that you have enjoyed one of the most terrifying and anguishing experiences in recent years that surprises with its impressive sound section, but also with that brilliant play of light and shadow that manages to drive you crazy every time. that the creature is near. Don't be fooled by the opening bars of <em>Amnesia: The Bunker</em>, they seemed horrible to me, that when you enter the bunker everything changes, and it is difficult not to be impressed with many of the terrifying images with which the game has the pleasure of delight you."

Going through the dark corridors of the claustrophobic bunker that gives its name to the game has been a terrifyingly fun experience that has caused me more than one scare, and the urgent need to leave the game even for a few minutes, to control my nerves. It loses some of its strength in its final stretch, but even so, with that story and all those lurid moments, if you're a fan of survival horror you shouldn't miss out on this game that's reminiscent of the first Resident Evil or Alien Isolation."

          "The first time I saw the trailer for <strong><em>Decarnation</em></strong> it caught my attention instantly. The two highlights of it are, in fact, the ones I've found in the final game: a really beautiful and worked style of pixel art, which does not skimp on animations for anything that reinforces the plot; and a story where terror is used in its most psychological aspect to address trauma in all its complexity.",
          "As the writer Ismael Martínez Biurrum explains in his essay I am what persecutes me. Terror as a fiction of trauma, the true terror is not in the monster itself nor in its grotesque proportions, but in the perspective and the damaged mind of the one who is harassed by these nightmares. Faced with a conflict, a truth that is too painful or damage that is too deep, the mind is capable of forming a story that is vividly expressed in good horror fiction. A kind of magical realism in the form of teeth, eyes and tentacles that oppress us.",
          "We have seen this way of applying terror in movies like Black Swan and in video games like <em>Silent Hill</em>. They are undoubtedly two key fictions to understand <a href='https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/decarnation/'><em>Decarnation</em></a> that even so knows how to apply the lessons of the genre to its own history. Gloria's: a cabaret dancer in late 1980s Paris whose life already falters a bit before it completely falls apart. Her future as a dancer is uncertain when she is close to thirty and her relationship with her girlfriend is not going through her best moment. But it all comes crashing down when the unthinkable happens. An event that deeply marks the course of events and plunges Gloria and the player into a spiral of uncomfortable situations, which are reinforced by nightmares and grotesque thoughts that arise from Gloria's fragile mind.",
          "<em>Decarnation</em> is an experience that, if you are looking for something beyond the action mechanics of the medium, deserves your attention. But this does not mean that we must not stop paying attention to the friction that the game presents when it tries to belong to our environment. I have always defended the artist's right to use the game as a narrative platform, even without the need to provide addictive mechanics that challenge the player, or test reflexes. I defend the right of the walking simulator to be a video game.",
          "Playing <em>Decarnation</em>, on the other hand, one gets the feeling that (curiously for a story that deals with this) the author succumbs to the fears of this type of completely narrative works. Not to be too video game. To do this, its 5-6 hours are filled with various mini-games and tests that do not contribute anything at all. On some occasions they will only take a few minutes from us, while on others they are large portions in which we have to search for objects or interact with the stage. But all of them have something in common: not only do they add nothing to the story and simply serve to make it feel more like a video game, but they cut the pace of the narrative, lengthening a story that would have felt more focused and light without all these mechanics.",
          "All in all, under these fears that we all carry and to which we all succumb from time to time, the first work of Atelier QDB, designed by ex-<em>Assassin's Creed</em> designer Quentin de Beukelair, is something that I would like to see more of in our format. . There is a unique sensibility that is even more sharpened by the beauty of its pixel and by the great soundtrack from which, curiously, Akira Yamaoka composes some of his pieces, and the ones that you will remember the most are the ones that have lyrics and accompany great moments of the plot. It is a pity that he has not found in the video game a way to reinforce his message."

However, it is also overshadowed by its attempt to include unnecessary gameplay mechanics that interrupt the narrative and detract from the story. overall experience. Instead of adding challenge and excitement, these mechanics seem like simply attempts to make Decarnation feel more like a traditional 'video game', leading to more moments of frustration than immersion. Despite these drawbacks, Decarnation has a unique ability to tell a story that uses terror to address trauma, while also being captivating."

There have been more than 50 hours of continuous massacre. To fight endlessly against endless hordes of bloodthirsty monsters. And even though I've finished with thousands of them I still want more. That's how good Diablo IV is. A spectacular action rpg that masterfully takes its fierce combats to the open world without losing a bit of everything that makes this Blizzard series great.",

The good thing is that the doubts are cleared as soon as you fight your first fights against the demons. It is tremendous.

The duration of <em>Diablo 4</em> if you go directly to the main missions is around 30 hours, but in each and every one of the five large regions that make up Sanctuary there are dozens of secondary missions that can increase the duration to 80 or 100 hours. That's not to mention the end game, which from what I've seen looks great. There are special missions on the one hand with their own rewards, and also areas of the map that are randomly thrown into chaos, presenting extreme challenges with their own unique resources and prizes. Come on, if it's not secondary and dungeons, it's going to be ultra-difficult battles, but the game has a lot to offer on your way to reaching level 100.",
          "I'll end by talking about the graphics, although I don't need to go on too long either because, you see, the game looks outrageously good. The design of the scenarios is a joy: they are bloody, dark and very varied between them, although what has surprised me the most is how well the different areas of the open world are connected, and how the transition between them feels logical and natural . There are cold steppes, snowy peaks, sand dunes in the desert, ruins in the middle of nowhere, or even swampy areas. When you get the horse, which I already warn you is going to take a few hours, getting lost in all these places is a great pleasure. Especially since the soundtrack is also at a very high level with a wide variety of songs that immerse you fully in the action of <em>Diablo</em>.",

          "If there is only one brand that represents fighting games, it is clearly <em>Street Fighter</em>. The Capcom franchise has been waging war for more than 30 years and fighting for the podium in a genre that is becoming more and more competitive. Its sixth numbered installment, <strong><em>Street Fighter 6</em></strong>, is about to drop, and it aims to be one of the most powerful bombings of the year. But the fighting game genre is now more demanding than it was before, what does this new game have to become the 2023 fighting GOTY? The truth is that a lot, and it all started with his first appearance in public.",
          "Despite playing very similar to <em>SF5</em> at first glance, the new <em>Street Fighter</em> has made many changes to its recipe. For starters, as I said before, the aesthetics of the game is radically different. Breaking quite a bit with the previous installments (which, for my taste, had been anchored in <em>Street Fighter 3</em> for a long time), <a href='https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/street-fighter-6/'><em>SF6</em></a> relies entirely on the 'Street' in its name. It is an intense game, with a very, very marked artistic style and brutal power. With powerful animations, eye-catching effects, and highly stylized designs, it exudes personality throughout.",
          "At a playable level, this new installment of the saga does not reinvent anything, something to be expected to keep its player base, but it does add a controversial element: the Drive System. With a new special bar, you'll have access to 5 new movement types that give duels in the game more depth and opportunities to turn the tables. With the Drive bar, you will be able to do an Impact (super armor attack that will leave the enemy at the mercy of a new combo), Parry (which will allow you to block almost any movement with just one button), Overdrive (the equivalent of EX in this game), Rush (a way to close distances through other moves to create better combos) and Reversal (which will get you out of pressure situations if executed well). Yes, I know that on paper this “sounds like a lot”, but in reality it is not so much.",
          "The efforts of the Japanese firm to attract new players do not end here: along with the control scheme of a lifetime (you know, the one with the croissants that we have been using since the 80s), we also have a modern mode and another assisted mode that will simplify Lots of action, though that doesn't mean you'll be given an unfair advantage at the push of a button. Although it is true that both are created to facilitate the gameplay (with the modern scheme simply reducing the number of inputs you must make, while the assisted one almost 'plays for you'), they also reduce the variety of commands and offensive possibilities, in addition Not to be, under any circumstances, a substitute for the knowledge and game feel that are only acquired with your experience in the ring.",
          "If you've been following <em>Street Fighter 6</em> since its first trailer, I'm sure this mode has been one of the things that has caught your attention the most. Putting you at the center of the action through a 100% customizable avatar (and what a game-consuming character editor!), you'll be in the eye of the hurricane of an international conspiracy. In your investigation, you will not only explore the open world of Metro City, but also iconic cities around the world to meet all the protagonists of the game.",
          "The dozens of hours I've spent on <em>Street Fighter 6</em> have not only delighted me, but have made it clear to me that Capcom's new golden age is a reality. With the string of successes that it has been accumulating, it is clear that it is one of the developers and publishers that best understands not only its community, but also the video game industry. This sixth installment of the Capcom saga is proof that the Japanese company knows what makes its brand special and what the fighting game genre needs in 2023."

          "resume": "With Street Fighter's pedigree, it's nice to see a release worthy of the saga. Capcom brings us one of the best releases I've seen in the history of fighting games and a strong candidate to be the king of the scene for the entire generation. The future will be decided with the news that they plan to include over the next 6-7 years, of course, but dedicating myself body and soul to this premiere has made one thing clear to me: if Street Fighter 6 follows the trajectory of its older version early, the competition is going to have a very difficult time snatching the championship belt from him."
